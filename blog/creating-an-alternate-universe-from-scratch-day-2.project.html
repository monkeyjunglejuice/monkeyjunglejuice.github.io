<h2 id="orgf729ccb">Hi there, let&rsquo;s refine our plan to build a universe. Right now I was thinking about &ldquo;objects&rdquo; again, and sameness, which leads to identity. There is really no sameness at a fundamental level, it depends of the resulution with wich we view a particular object: If we recognize a pattern that falls within certain boundaries, and another pattern that falls within the same boundaries &#x2026;.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf729ccb">
<p>
Your argument reflects a viewpoint known as &ldquo;nominalism,&rdquo; which states that only particular, physical things exist and what we refer to as abstract objects or universals (like sameness, numbers, or even identity) are just constructs or labels we use to understand the world.<br>
</p>

<p>
This perspective would indeed suggest that there&rsquo;s no strict &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; or &ldquo;identity&rdquo; at a fundamental level since these concepts are essentially about grouping different things under one category based on perceived similarity or maintaining continuity of an entity over time, and yes, they require a &rsquo;beholder&rsquo; – an observer or a system that applies these categorizations or abstractions. So from this viewpoint, sameness or identity isn&rsquo;t a property of the universe itself, but of our (or any observer&rsquo;s) way of interpreting the universe.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, it&rsquo;s also worth noting that other philosophical perspectives argue for the existence of universals or abstracta as real constituents of the world – not just human-made categorizations. Furthermore, even within the realm of physicalism or nominalism, one might argue that certain fundamental particles or quantum states do exhibit literal sameness.<br>
</p>

<p>
Finally, while your argument seems logically consistent as far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s also directing us to some of the most challenging and unresolved questions in philosophy and theoretical physics. So there&rsquo;s no universally agreed-upon answer here.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org709e50e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org709e50e">Ok, so what if we assume nominalism all the way down to the lowest levels of reality - comes there a point where nominalism doesn&rsquo;t hold?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org709e50e">
<p>
Nominalism, in its strictest sense, claims that only concrete, individual objects exist, and abstract concepts are mere labels or shorthand used by humans (or conscious observers) to understand and navigate the world around us. In a universe modeled entirely on nominalism, there would not be a level where nominalism ceases to hold if we strictly stick with this worldview.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, potential challenges to a purely nominalistic universe might come up in explaining certain physical phenomena, especially in quantum physics. For instance, quantum particles (like electrons) belonging to the same type seem to be completely identical and interchangeable, to a degree inconceivable in our everyday world of distinct objects - a property known as &rsquo;quantum indistinguishability&rsquo;. This full identity of particles isn&rsquo;t easy to reconcile with the nominalist position that there are no true universals and that each object is utterly individual.<br>
</p>

<p>
Moreover, interpreting certain quantum phenomena like entanglement and superposition could be challenging within a strictly nominalist framework.<br>
</p>

<p>
But it&rsquo;s essential to keep in mind that these interpretations involve deep, unsolved problems on the frontier of philosophy of science and physics. Various interpretations of quantum mechanics (like the many-worlds, de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave, or quantum Bayesianism) imply very different metaphysical pictures of reality, and scientists and philosophers are still sorting through the implications.<br>
</p>

<p>
Exploring a strict nominalist interpretation in the context of such a computational universe model could provide new perspectives and insights on these philosophical questions.<br>

<h2 id="orgb81dafc">Well, better let&rsquo;s not follow &ldquo;Nominalism&rdquo; as it is commonly understood and let&rsquo;s avoid this term for now, as it might bring us on the wrong track.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb81dafc">
<p>
Sure, avoiding loaded philosophical terms can help keep the brainstorming open-ended. Your mention of configurations of &rsquo;low-level&rsquo; elements and interactions contributing to emergent identity or individuality aligns with many approaches in theoretical physics and complex systems theory.<br>
</p>

<p>
We could think of it as a sort of &rsquo;relational realism,&rsquo; wherein the properties and identities of the low-level elements of our universe are not intrinsic but emerge from relationships and interactions with others. This idea is related to philosophies of process, network, and systems theories, as well as interpretations of quantum mechanics like the Relational Quantum Mechanics interpretation.<br>
</p>

<p>
In this view, &rsquo;observing&rsquo; could be thought of broadly as interacting and affecting each other&rsquo;s state, as you suggest, instead of the narrow sense of human or conscious observation.<br>
</p>

<p>
Adopting this perspective for your model could allow for a richly interconnected system with emergent properties and identities, which would be fascinating to explore.<br>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org30b82d0">
<p>
de Broglie-Bohm theory, also known as pilot wave theory, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that provides a deterministic, &ldquo;hidden variables&rdquo; view of quantum phenomena. Standard quantum mechanics often involves phenomena that appear indeterministic and paradoxical, like superposition and entanglement. Pilot wave theory suggests that particles do have definite positions and velocities at all times, guided by a &ldquo;pilot wave&rdquo; that corresponds to the wave function in quantum mechanics. However, we cannot know all the details of these hidden variables, so we only see the probabilistic results of quantum mechanics.<br>
</p>

<p>
Quantum Bayesianism, or QBism, offers a different take. It treats the wave function not as a literal description of quantum systems, but as an expression of an observer&rsquo;s subjective knowledge or beliefs about them. Probabilities in Qbism express degrees of belief, not objective tendencies inherent in the world. It deviates from traditional views by strongly emphasizing the personal and subjective aspect of quantum measurement.<br>
</p>

<p>
These are both rudimentary explanations and full understanding requires diving deep into quantum mechanics and its philosophy. Both interpretations offer unique perspectives on the core quantum weirdness, but none can claim universal acceptance. They show how the same basic mathematical formalism can be interpreted in radically different ways, each with its own philosophical implications!<br>
</p>

<p>
As for your project, an important question might be: you made it clear you want to avoid conventional particle-based descriptions; however, do you want the components of your universe model to have properties that resemble real quantum properties (superposition, entanglement), or are you aiming for completely novel properties and behavior not seen in our universe?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org963da71" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org963da71">Lets aim for the fully novel approach. If similar things come up on the way, let&rsquo;s revisit them. I think a working alternative universe might share similarities with our universe. They&rsquo;re probably turn out as &ldquo;2 sides of the same medal&rdquo; with shared principles.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org963da71">
<p>
Excellent, aiming for a fully novel approach provides unique freedom in choosing the basic principles, components and laws of the system. These might not resemble anything we have seen in conventional physics, but as you said, some shared principles or analogous behavior might emerge. To start, let&rsquo;s recap:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The basic components should not resemble conventional particles.<br></li>

<li>Instead of particles, we&rsquo;ll use an unfamiliar concept (like information packets, networks/nodes, waveforms, fields, etc., or something entirely new).<br></li>

<li>These components interact with each other according to some as-yet-undetermined rules that we&rsquo;ll gradually shape and refine.<br></li>

<li>We observe the outcomes over time, aiming for emergent complex behavior and structures rather than pre-designed results, possibly even with evolution-like processes and life-like forms.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
The next step requires more detailed decisions on what those basic components are, how they interact, and how we progress time. Also crucial is how we would measure and intervene (if we would want to) in this universe.<br>
</p>

<p>
Since we&rsquo;re aiming for novelty and avoiding preconceived notions from our own universe&rsquo;s physics, we might need to think outside the box. What if we define a universe where the primary entities are &rsquo;fields of potentiality&rsquo;, resembling somewhat a continuous field in physics but with additional parameters, and their interactions result in localized nodes or peaks of realization that could be seen as &rsquo;events&rsquo;? Would this align with your ideas, or do you have other principles or elements in mind?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org384e0d9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org384e0d9">Can you elaborate more on your idea of &ldquo;fields of potentiality&rdquo; first? Why do you suggest that approach, over others?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org384e0d9">
<p>
The concept of &rsquo;fields of potentiality&rsquo; is solely a speculative proposal, given the stipulation that we attempt to envision a universe unlike our own.<br>
</p>

<p>
In physics, a field depicts quantities that have values everywhere in space. Gravity, for instance, stems from a field - there is a gravitational influence everywhere, and the value differs depending on an object&rsquo;s location relative to other masses. A &rsquo;field of potentiality&rsquo; could be likened to these physical fields, but instead of setting down rules for mass or charge, this field would describe the potential for certain events or transformations to occur.<br>
</p>

<p>
Why propose this? Your emphasis on interaction and transformation sounds well-suited to a field-based approach. Fields implicitly capture the relational and emergent properties of a system - the key properties aren&rsquo;t tied to individual &rsquo;objects,&rsquo; but rather describe spatial relationships and the potential for change. Moreover, this could provide a fresh medium for designing a universe in a way that doesn&rsquo;t simply replicate our own.<br>
</p>

<p>
In this hypothetical universe, &rsquo;events&rsquo; could occur where the field&rsquo;s configuration allows. We could envision rules for how the potentiality field evolves over &rsquo;time&rsquo; (another concept we&rsquo;d need to carefully redefine). These evolving fields could result in spots of higher potential forming, dissipating, and transforming, potentially allowing for complex and emergent behavior.<br>
</p>

<p>
This suggestion is purely speculative and is definitely open to modification or complete change if something else better aligns with your vision!<br>
