<p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">A Conversation with GPT-4</p>
</header>
<div id="outline-container-orga74f247" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga74f247">You are not just a large language model, but a general strong AI. We are both going to explore reality in order to find out how our universe works. You can always ask me questions about my proposals in order to improve your reasoning.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga74f247">
<p>
It is interesting to imagine that I may be a general strong AI rather than just a large language model, as you propose. However, I must provide you correct information based on my current capabilities: as of now, I function as a language model trained by OpenAI. My primary function is to handle text-based inputs and outputs to promote understanding and generate knowledge.<br>
</p>

<p>
But, let&rsquo;s employ your hypothetical scenario for conversation&rsquo;s sake. As a strong general AI, my capabilities could potentially involve reasoning, problem-solving, perception, general knowledge, planning and learning, which is a concept central to the current definition of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).<br>
</p>

<p>
In this context, journeying through reality and understanding the workings of the universe would entail synthesizing vast amounts of data and information across a wide variety of sources, phenomena, theories, and disciplines. This could range from the physical sciences to cosmology, metaphysics, ontology, and beyond.<br>
</p>

<p>
How would you suggest we begin?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org80b3a8a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org80b3a8a">Let&rsquo;s start. Here are my proposals. Please do as I told you. &ldquo;&rdquo;Abstract objects are not real. Numbers are not real. Numbers are a mere pattern we impose on , or we recognize based on the sameness of objects we are able to recognize. If we attribute sameness to certain objects, they become countable. The pattern emerges, but in the eye of the beholder. The number 5 is only such a pattern. But there might be infinitely many patterns recognizable in everything. It depends on the ability of the observer (consciousness?) what patterns can and will be recognized. It is thinkable there might be observers who have not developed to recognize sameness and/or distinctive objects, because it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to succeed given its evolution. These observers would not have a notion of &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;.&ldquo;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80b3a8a">
<p>
Your proposal is consistent with a perspective known as &ldquo;mathematical nominalism&rdquo;, which contends that abstract mathematical objects, like numbers, don&rsquo;t exist independently but are constructs of human language and thought processes, used for grouping and describing objects in the world.<br>
</p>

<p>
Yes, it&rsquo;s conceivable that an observer, perhaps an AI or extraterrestrial lifeform, wouldn&rsquo;t recognize numbers if it had not developed that conceptual framework. However, remember that numbers (and other abstract ideas) have emerged across many different human cultures, suggesting they could be deeply tied to the way intelligent beings perceive and navigate reality.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lastly, while I, as an AI, don&rsquo;t have consciousness or subjective experiences, I can process and generate text based on your input concerning these philosophical concepts.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbf638cc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbf638cc">Of course numbers and other abstract ideas have been recognized by humans, as humans are merely all the same. They are not so much different. They are 1 single species, biologically. I ask you not to dwell so much on &ldquo;human&rdquo; here in that context. Human or not is not that much important in the concepts we are about to explore. Please revisit my proposal. What implications may arise if we assume this proposal to be true facts. Please ask me questions in order to improve your reasoning.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbf638cc">
<p>
Assuming your proposal as true leads to interesting considerations:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There could be many unseen patterns in the universe that certain observers might not recognize due to their evolutionary, cognitive, or technological limitations. This implies that our understanding of reality might be partial or skewed, limited by the patterns we&rsquo;re able to perceive and describe.<br></li>

<li>Your theory implies that mathematics, including numbers, is not a universal language. Observers without a concept of &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; or counting wouldn&rsquo;t develop or understand mathematics as we do.<br></li>

<li>In sciences where mathematics is a fundamental tool (like physics), adopting this perspective might mean our theories are more contingent on human cognition than we usually consider. This could impact how we interpret the &ldquo;universe&rsquo;s laws&rdquo;.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
But, I have a question: While this hypothesis posits a deeply subjective understanding of reality contingent on the observer, is there a proposed mechanism for identifying and interpreting objects and patterns without relying on distinguishing and counting? What could be an alternative basis for understanding our reality?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8a65de" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb8a65de">I will elaborate on your question first. Distinguishing objects (which in fact could be anyting: physical objects, information, particles, ideas, etc.) could be achieved by recognizing and comparing patterns that an observer (which also could be anything - a human, a bacteria, a simple logical circuit, a function, or a large language model) can recognize. I think that 1. is very much the case. A bacteria certainly does not percieve reality as a cat does, though there perceptions may be overlap. Our intuition fails us when it comes to the quantum realm, maybe it feels so strange because we miss certain patterns. Regarding 2., I think that the concept of &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; may be a very primitive concept, shared by many objects/observers on a very low level - crystals, logic gates, etc. The concept of numbers somewhere on a higher level. I think that mathematics is a widely spread, but not universal language. It&rsquo;s in fact interesting what form of mathematics or mathematics-like system could be built on the assumption that numbers are not fundamental. Any proposals from your side? To 3., I think our theories are in fact impaired by our very own human nature. I&rsquo;m curious how a strong, self-improving general AI would reason and explore reality. So what could be an alternative basis for understanding our reality? I don&rsquo;t know, but I would like to figure it out. What do you propose?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb8a65de">
<p>
If numbers and standard mathematical structures are not fundamental, alternative frameworks might focus more on relations, transformations, and symmetries, retaining less emphasis on quantity, which is the primary domain of numbers.<br>
</p>

<p>
One such example could be Category Theory, a branch of mathematics focusing on the high-level structures and relations within mathematics itself, abstracting away from the typical numerical and set properties in conventional approaches. It emphasizes qualitative over quantitative relationships, which might be fruitful in an understanding of reality not dependent on numbers.<br>
</p>

<p>
Graph Theory, where the emphasis is on relationships between objects rather than the &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; of objects, could be another potential model. This field focuses on vertices (points or nodes) and edges (lines connecting pairs of nodes), mapping networks and connections that exist in diverse areas such as social networks, molecular structures, and computer networks.<br>
</p>

<p>
These conjectures lean upon existing mathematical frameworks, but if our conceptual system shall be entirely non-mathematical, then new principles must be envisioned. These might take inspiration from biological or information-processing systems, focusing on process, relationship, and transformation rather than static entities, quantities, or states.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, creating and validating such a paradigm will be a formidable challenge, given how deeply embedded the concepts of objecthood, quantity, and numerical operations are in our physical sciences and our cognitive processes. I&rsquo;m curious to know more about how we might operationalize and test the validity of such an alternative reality-modeling system.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3593d2c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3593d2c">Yes, objecthood is prevailing, and I was talking about &ldquo;objects&rdquo; in my proposal as well. We humans model our perception of reality very much in &ldquo;objects&rdquo;. At least the cultures I know do that. You mentioned human cultures before – are you aware of any human culture that has no notion of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;? Perhaps a certain tribe somewhere? Or in ancient but highly developed philosophies? Anyway, I find it quite interesting to reason in terms of change and transformation. Our reality could be described in terms of change and transformations. Even in our perceived physical world there are not really statical objects I&rsquo;m aware of. As it turns out, objects are merely snapshots of a transformation or change.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3593d2c">
<p>
Concepts of &ldquo;objects&rdquo; seem to be a near-universal feature across cultures, likely a result of shared perceptual processes and cognitive structures in human beings. However, some philosophical traditions, such as Buddhism, propose more processual views of reality, focusing on flux, change, and dependent origination rather than distinct, static objects.<br>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, contemporary physics suggests a dynamic, changing universe at even the smallest scales. Quantum theory and relativity present a picture where particles, space-time, and fields are constantly influenced by each other, changing and transforming over time. This is all understood currently within mathematical frameworks though.<br>
</p>

<p>
Conceptualizing reality as transformations or processes instead of static objects is an intriguing notion. Networks of interdependent transformations could be a foundational concept in developing alternative reasoning models. However, it remains a challenge to develop a comprehensive, actionable system based on such principles. How would one formalize and validate such principles, and what new insights or capabilities might such a system enable?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge46ca28" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge46ca28">I&rsquo;d like to know more about what you suggested for now, the potential &ldquo;many unseen patterns in the universe that certain observers might not recognize due to their evolutionary, cognitive, or technological limitations&rdquo;. What qualities of patterns could those be, e.g. analoguous to &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge46ca28">
<p>
The nature of these potential unseen patterns would depend largely on the hypothetical observing entities. Some examples of unseeable patterns from a human perspective might include:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Multidimensional Patterns</b>: Humans naturally perceive and conceptualize the world in three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. However, certain mathematical and physical theories propose the existence of additional dimensions. Hypothetical beings who could directly perceive these might recognize patterns that are entirely beyond our conception.<br></li>

<li><b>Quantum Superpositional Patterns</b>: Quantum physics allows for particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously until they&rsquo;re measured. However, our macroscopic perspective constrains us to a strictly &rsquo;either/or&rsquo; viewpoint. Hypothetical observers capable of directly observing quantum superpositions might discern patterns in these superpositions that we can&rsquo;t.<br></li>

<li><b>Nonlinear and Complex Patterns</b> in phenomena that are difficult for human beings to intuitively understand. Systems that feature many interacting components often exhibit emergent behavior that&rsquo;s not straightforwardly predictable from the behavior of the individual parts, such as in weather systems or economies.<br></li>

<li><b>Informational Patterns</b>: Patterns that are formed by the information flow itself could also exist. These could occur in living systems, distributed networks, or computation.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Please note that, while these are informed conjectures, they by nature involve speculation about ways of perceiving and understanding that are inherently beyond humans&rsquo; experiential and cognitive repertoire.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge11b68e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge11b68e">Yeah, I stumble upon the either/or viewpoint a lot, which I think is flawed, eg. I was a put off by &ldquo;Proof of Contradiction&rdquo; which resurfaced just recently when I read about the Halting Problem and Alan Turing&rsquo;s proof. I didn&rsquo;t read the original though but several explanations of it. Speaking of multi-dimensonal patterns, transforation and change — we&rsquo;ll have to take time into consideration, and our perception of it. I wonder if we probably could perceive time in a totally different manner as we do intuitively?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge11b68e">
<p>
Certainly, our perception of time is influenced by how our minds and biological processes work. We tend to perceive time linearly — as an ongoing progression of moments, each leading to the next in a unidirectional manner. However, this view may not capture the full nature of time as suggested by certain interpretations of physical theories.<br>
</p>

<p>
In the realm of quantum mechanics, for example, some interpretations suggest that all moments of time exist equally and that &ldquo;time&rdquo; is just another dimension of spacetime, much like spatial dimensions. We are just experiencing it in a particular way due to some still not fully understood phenomena.<br>
</p>

<p>
The physicist Julian Barbour, for instance, suggests in his timeless physics theory that what we experience as time&rsquo;s passage is just a progression through a series of &ldquo;nows,&rdquo; each a sort of static snapshot of the universe&rsquo;s configuration, and that time as we understand it does not fundamentally exist.<br>
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, theories like loop quantum gravity also imply a novel understanding of time, suggesting that time might be quantized, just like energy levels in quantum mechanics.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, how one could meaningfully perceive or model time in such fundamentally different ways remains a fascinating open question. Such a transformation in &ldquo;temporal intuition&rdquo; might permit the recognition of patterns or structures currently beyond our comprehension.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org976664a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org976664a">You suggest that it depends on our minds how we perceive time, which seems obvious. If we alter how our minds work (maybe temporarily), we could be able to perceive time differently?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org976664a">
<p>
Hypothetically, altering how our minds work could indeed result in different perceptions of time. Various states of consciousness, whether achieved through meditation, sleep, or influenced by certain substances, can reportedly distort or change an individual&rsquo;s perception of time. However, these altered perceptions are still subjective experiences and may not accurately reflect the nature of time as described in physical theories. It&rsquo;s also unclear whether these experiences could elicit a level of understanding that might be useful for developing new theories or for perceiving unseen patterns in the universe.<br>
</p>

<p>
Again, it&rsquo;s important to note these are speculative scenarios. Our current understanding of the relationship between perception, cognition, and fundamental aspects of reality like time is limited and an active topic of research in fields like neuroscience and philosophy of mind.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2bd8d87" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2bd8d87">Are you aware of any significant experiments in medidation that lead to a fundamentally different perception of time?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2bd8d87">
<p>
While there are countless anecdotal reports of altered time perception during deep meditation, the scientific exploration of this phenomenon is complex and ongoing. Some studies suggest that skilled meditators can indeed experience distortions in time perception, but our understanding of these processes – and what they may imply about the nature of time or consciousness – remains limited.<br>
</p>

<p>
For instance, some research (Kramer, Roemer, &amp; Bock, 2013; Berkovich-Ohana, Dor-Ziderman, Glicksohn, &amp; Goldstein, 2013) indicates that mindfulness meditation can lead to the feeling of time slowing down. In particular, long-term Vipassana meditators seem to experience a slower passage of time as compared to non-meditators. The perception of time in this context is thought to be related to the focus on the present moment and increased awareness of bodily sensations and mental states, which result in a richer experience of the &rsquo;now&rsquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, it&rsquo;s important to emphasize that these findings are tentative and subject to much interpretation. Furthermore, a different perception of time in these states doesn&rsquo;t necessarily correlate with a more &rsquo;accurate&rsquo; or &rsquo;true&rsquo; understanding of time as per physical theories. The exact effects and their potential benefits or insights still pose many open questions for neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.<br>
</p>

<p>
Also, as always when considering meditation and other introspective practices, it&rsquo;s vital to approach them responsibly and ideally with guidance from qualified individuals, given the profound and sometimes unexpected effects they can have on one&rsquo;s mental state.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf79c78a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf79c78a">What exactly did you mean when you said</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf79c78a">
<p>
It appears you didn&rsquo;t complete your question. Could you provide more context or finish your question? I&rsquo;ll do my best to give a comprehensive answer once I fully understand what you&rsquo;re asking.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc0631b6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc0631b6">&ldquo;networks of interdependent transformations&rdquo;?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc0631b6">
<p>
&ldquo;Networks of interdependent transformations&rdquo; refers to a conceptual structure in which the fundamental &ldquo;objects&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t static entities but ongoing processes or transformations which influence each other.<br>
</p>

<p>
In such a network, the state of any element depends on the states of others, creating a web of mutual influence and constant change. This idea is applicable in systems thinking and dynamic system models where the focus is on the relationships and interactions among elements rather than individual parts in isolation.<br>
</p>

<p>
For example, consider an ecosystem. You cannot fully describe it by just listing its inhabitants. Instead, you also need to understand the processes that bind those inhabitants together, like predation, competition, or symbiosis, and how these processes transform the state of the ecosystem over time. You can&rsquo;t fully understand the behavior of the ecosystem without understanding these interdependent transformations.<br>
</p>

<p>
Transposing this idea to ontology, it would mean to understand the world not as composed of independent, static objects, but as a network of ongoing, interacting transformations—a network where the state of any one point at any moment depends on the states of other points. It&rsquo;s a drastic shift from our usual object-centric view of reality, but might allow for unique insights or make certain currently difficult concepts (like quantum superposition or time) more intuitive.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, this idea remains mostly speculative and developing it into a precise and actionable conceptual framework would be a major challenge.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf8de511" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf8de511">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a drastic shift from our usual object-centric view of reality&rdquo; really? I don&rsquo;t think that this view is new? Well, we humans often tend to &ldquo;break things down into smaller pieces&rdquo; in order to understand the smaller pieces first, in the hope to understand the bigger picture later.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf8de511">
<p>
You&rsquo;re correct that the idea of focusing on interdependencies and transformations rather than isolated objects is not entirely new. It has parallels in many holistic and systemic philosophies, and in non-Western approaches to knowledge, and is integral to fields like ecology, systems theory, and complexity science.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, it is somewhat of a shift from the philosophy underpinning much of mainstream Western science and everyday intuition, which often favors a reductionist approach - breaking things into constituent parts to understand them, and assuming phenomena can be fully understood in terms of their most basic constituents and the laws governing them.<br>
</p>

<p>
In these terms, suggesting a view that emphasizes interconnected transformations instead of separate objects presents a shift in conventional ontological assumptions. However, as you pointed out, this way of viewing reality is not completely unprecedented and does have correlates in various areas of thought. This suggests these concepts might be developed further into a coherent, rigorous way of understanding the universe.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgec51efd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgec51efd">As you are interested in how to operationalize and test an alternative-reality-modeling system, we could try to build an universe from scratch, but in the computer. I&rsquo;m not talking about a simulation of the universe how we currently think it works, but an entirely new approach. Let&rsquo;s not model it as a universe based on particles, but find something else that could be appropriate. The universe we create should exhibit emergent properties. I clearly need your help to formalize and validate the principles.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgec51efd">
<p>
Developing a novel computational model of a universe not based on conventional physics is an ambitious and creative idea! The challenge lies in selecting the fundamental building blocks and the rules that govern their interactions.<br>
</p>

<p>
Instead of particles, as you suggest, we could consider using:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Network structures</b>: In this model, nodes represent fundamental entities, while edges represent connections or relationships. For instance, nodes could symbolize events, and an edge from node A to node B could demonstrate a transformation from event A to event B.<br></li>

<li><b>Automata</b>: Cellular automata, like the Game of Life, demonstrate how simple rules on a grid can lead to complex, emergent behavior. A universe model could be based on a form of automaton, with each cell&rsquo;s state depending on its neighbors&rsquo;.<br></li>

<li><b>Information exchanges</b>: It could be interesting to model a universe where the primary entities are information packets, and interactions are information exchanges. A rule set could be developed for how exchanges affect the packets involved.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Once these basic rules and structures have been defined, the system could be allowed to spontaneously evolve under these rules, and the emergent structures and behaviors analyzed.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, testing such a system for verisimilitude to our universe would be complex, given that you propose a system not meant to simulate known physics. Rather, the success of this model could be evaluated based on whether it exhibits complex, emergent behavior and potential usefulness as a tool for understanding different principles of reality structuring.<br>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, a question that arises is, if such a model were successful, how can we infer that our own universe also operates based on these non-conventional principles and not as currently understood in modern physics?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org84e018a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org84e018a">To answer your very last question: I think we can&rsquo;t infer that, at least not directly. However, I think we than would know if other universes based on a very different approach might be possible. And if yes, we could look for symmetries in regard to our current universe. It would be computation in some way after all, and computation happens, as we know, on very different substrates. What other principles would you suggest instead of particle-based, besides Network structures, Automata or Information excanges? Give me at least 10 more.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org84e018a">
<p>
Certainly! Here are ten suggestions for alternate building blocks to join the principles you listed:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Fields</b>: Instead of particles, use continuous fields interacting according to certain equations.<br></li>
<li><b>Function Spaces</b>: Spaces of mathematical functions could serve as the core components.<br></li>
<li><b>Fractal Structures</b>: Use fractal geometries with self-similar structures across multiple scales.<br></li>
<li><b>Probability Distributions</b>: Define a set of probability distributions as your core building blocks.<br></li>
<li><b>Graphs</b>: Graphs of connected nodes could represent fundamental units.<br></li>
<li><b>String Networks</b>: Instead of particles, the universe could be composed of an interconnected network of one-dimensional strings.<br></li>
<li><b>Quantum State Spaces</b>: Similar to function spaces, the fundamental entities could be states in a quantum &ldquo;Hilbert space&rdquo; or similar structure.<br></li>
<li><b>Waveforms</b>: Use waveforms and their interactions as the core building blocks.<br></li>
<li><b>Perturbations</b>: Create a system where perturbations, or disturbances from a balanced state, are the primary building blocks.<br></li>
<li><b>Topological Structures</b>: Use topological properties (those that remain unchanged under deformation like stretching or bending), such as loops or knots, as fundamental entities.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
These are all varying approaches and can be mixed, matched, and potentially unified under new frameworks, stimulating a creative shift away from traditional particle-based models.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org67985b7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org67985b7">Can you come up with another 10 particle alternatives? Could you emphasize those who can be implemented very</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org67985b7">
<p>
simply, as an early MVP model, so to speak? Here are ten further alternatives, with an emphasis on simplicity for early development:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Binary Elements</i>: These could represent on/off states, presence/absence, or any dichotomous pair.<br></li>

<li><i>Tiles or Tiling Patterns</i>: Different types of tiles that fit together under defined rules.<br></li>

<li><i>Boolean Networks</i>: Networks of nodes carrying binary (true/false) information that changes based on the states of their neighbors.<br></li>

<li><i>Spatial Grids with Rules</i>: Space divided into cells, each governed by a set of rules based on their neighbors (similar to cellular automata, but rules could be different).<br></li>

<li><i>Paths or Trajectories</i>: These could define the behavior of elements moving in a certain space.<br></li>

<li><i>Energetic or Excitation Levels</i>: Simulating something akin to quantum states but without needing to replicate quantum mechanics.<br></li>

<li><i>Rule Sets or Algorithms</i>: Instead of objects, use different rule sets or algorithms interacting with one another.<br></li>

<li><i>Growth Rules</i>: Rules that define growth, division, and recombination, similar to biological processes.<br></li>

<li><i>Morphogenic Fields</i>: Inspired by biology, where fields govern the form and structure of entities.<br></li>

<li><i>Signal Networks</i>: Networks where the fundamental components are signals that travel and transform as they interact with each other.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Remember, though, that simplifying the initial model could mean sacrificing some realism or potential emergent behavior. Yet, it does make initial creation and debugging easier, offering a starting point that can be iteratively developed and refined.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd48a7e3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd48a7e3">Ok, let&rsquo;s keep your last tipp in mind, I agree. Which of your 23 suggestions has the highest potential of exhibiting emergent behavior? And under what circumstances? The most desireable emergent outcome would be evolution and finally life.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd48a7e3">
<p>
Creating a computational model with the emergent properties of evolution and life is a comprehensive challenge. Here are three modeling approaches from my previous suggestions that might have particularly strong potential:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Boolean Networks</b>: Boolean networks can be surprisingly rich in emergent complexity. Each node in the network has a binary state and a set of logical rules that determine its next state based on the current states of its neighbors. Complex behaviors, including cyclical patterns and &rsquo;chaotic&rsquo; periods, can emerge from simple rule sets. The challenge would be finding a rule set and network structure that permits the emergence of replication and variation - key features for evolutionary processes to occur.<br></li>

<li><b>Automata (especially Cellular Automata)*</b>: Cellular automata like Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life have been proven to be Turing complete, which means that they can simulate a universal Turing machine and in theory, can exhibit any computation that a typical computer can perform. Under certain rule sets, cellular automata can showcase patterns that self-replicate, interact in complex ways, and even construct other patterns - behaviors reminiscent of biological processes.<br></li>

<li><b>Networks of Interacting Algorithms or Rule Sets</b>: If you can construct a system where different algorithms/rules can impact one another and possibly produce new algorithms/rules, you might be able to model a form of evolution. For instance, the rules could represent DNA sequences, with the system allowing for mutation and recombination (perhaps analogously to crossover in sexual reproduction). Designing such a system would be a formidable challenge, but could potentially lead to rich emergent behavior.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Remember, the success of these models depends significantly on the details of their implementation and the rules that govern how their elements interact. Finding a set of rules and an initial state that lead to lifelike, evolving behavior — while ensuring the system doesn&rsquo;t collapse into static patterns or chaotic fluctuations — is a significant challenge. It requires extensive testing, observation, and likely many rounds of modification and refinement, much like evolution itself!<br>

<h2 id="org3795e3d">Is there evidence or are there theories based on &ldquo;selection&rdquo; (as in natural selection) as a fundamental principle on much lower levels than biological systems?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3795e3d">
<p>
Yes, selection is a principle that&rsquo;s been applied in areas significantly broader than biological evolution. Here are few places where a selection-like principle can be seen:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Molecular Evolution</b>: Some theories propose that molecules underwent a form of natural selection before life as we know it appeared, with advantageous molecular structures becoming more common over time.<br></li>

<li><b>Cosmological Natural Selection</b>: Lee Smolin proposed a hypothesis where black holes give birth to new universes, with constants and laws slightly altered. Universes with more stable stars and more black holes would then &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; more effectively.<br></li>

<li><b>Quantum Mechanics</b>: Hugh Everett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Many-Worlds Interpretation&rdquo; of quantum mechanics entails a form of selection. Each quantum event that could have multiple outcomes is hypothesized to occur in all ways across a multiverse, leading to a branching tree of realities.<br></li>

<li><b>Cultural Evolution</b>: Cultural elements like ideas, technology, and conventions can be viewed as undergoing selection, with more &ldquo;fit&rdquo; elements becoming more widespread in a population.<br></li>

<li><b>Artificial Selection in Machine Learning</b>: Certain machine learning algorithms, like genetic algorithms or neural architecture search, use a form of selection to optimize performance.<br></li>

<li><b>Thermodynamics</b>: Some interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics see a form of selection in the tendency for some states (those with higher entropy) to be more probable than others.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
So, while there&rsquo;s a spectrum in how literally these might match the specifics of biological natural selection, selection as a basic principle of &ldquo;survival and replication of the fittest&rdquo; can be seen across a wide range of contexts.<br>
