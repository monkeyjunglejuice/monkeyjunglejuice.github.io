NOT STARTED YET -- I'm going to work on the model after the metaphysical framework is done. If you would like to ponder ideas, I'll be glad for your input. You will find the [[https://github.com/monkeyjunglejuice/protoverse][source code on Github]]

* The Process Abstraction

/This is about [[file:metaphysics.protoverse.project.org][Process (metaphysics]]); not to confuse with process or thread (computation)./

The Process abstracion is prior, and it's the only truly scale-invariant principle. Processes do not exist /within/ an environment or within space or time -- instead, the relational dynamics of processes bring about perceived structures and dimensions, as they continuously /become/ their environment, actively co-creating (resp. co-evolving) the substrate they are operating in.

** Interaction Dynamics

*** Ideas for the Initial Epistemological Scope of Primitive Processes

As Processes evolve and emerge higher-order Processes, it's reasonable to assume that the interactions could become more complex, transcending this initial scope. Some crude ideas:

**** 1. Idea: Lexical Scope and Black Boxes
There are no isolated Processes ("closed systems"), but a Process =P= cannot fully access the state of an arbitrary Process =Q= it interacts with. The arbitrary Process =Q= can initially only be understood in terms of a blackbox and successively modelling thereof, and interacted with according to the interfaces the Process =Q= exposes. Interfaces may adapt through ongoing interaction.

The interaction =P âˆ§ Q= leads to an aggregate Processes (higher-order Process) =PQ=.

This interaction between both might also create or alter sub-Processes =Px= and =Qx= within the boundaries of =P'= and =Q'=. The sub-processes =P'.X= and =Q'.X= can be fully accessed only by their respective super-Processes, while they cannot fully access the state of their super-Processes =P'= and =Q'= (same as the initial situation); hence =P.X= and =Q.X= need to reseort to black box analysis. While doing so, they have to create an inner model =P.X.Y= and =Q.X.Y=, and that would lead to an infinite regress, but not if each inner, newly spawned sub-Process is always a primitive Process.

However, it is unclear yet how far the access to newly initiated sub-Processes =P.X= reaches, and under what circumstances, and if or to which extent the super-Process =P'= gradually loose access to these newly emerged child Processes, e.g. =P.X=, =P.X.Z=, etc.

Maybe the access decays, the more interactions the evolved Processes =P'= and =Q'= experience (more relations piling up in their interaction logs) without further involvement of the child Processes =Xn=? Also, access from parent Processes to child Process may decay the more independent interactions the child Processes experience; the "further away" they get?

**** 2. Idea:
