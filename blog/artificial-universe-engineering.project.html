<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org91dfa9b">
<p>
The Protoverse is not made from things (like particles or objects and such), but <i>processes</i>. What we typically conceive of as entities (&ldquo;things&rdquo;) are actually temporary aggregations of Processes and their interactions &#x2013; it&rsquo;s Processes all the way down. The Protoverse is relational, co-evolving (darwin-style) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_independence">backdrop-independent</a>; hence there&rsquo;s no a-priori conception of time, space or gravity; although from Processes interacting on certain scales, constants could emerge, resembling a form of &ldquo;physics&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
The prime abstraction is &ldquo;Process&rdquo; (with capital &rsquo;P&rsquo;). Through the interaction, uniform primitive Processes build relations and compose, so that higher-order Processes emerge. Processes constantly become their own &ldquo;computing substrate&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s in principle quite like cellular automata work, where the grid is not a pre-defined &ldquo;space&rdquo;, but each cell&rsquo;s state at a given step is determined by the states of its neighbouring cells at the previous step, so that the structure of the grid is inherently linked to the operation of the automaton (this aspect may be overlooked when playing with cellular automata within apps, where cellular automata are always displayed in an area of a certain size).<br>

<h2 id="orge86801a"><a href="#orge86801a">Dynamic Structures</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge86801a">
<p>
The Protoverse needs to run on digital computers, since we don&rsquo;t have anything more sophisticated yet at scale. Digital computers operate inherently and efficiently with discrete structures &#x2013; so it would be generally reasonable to stick to discrete structures.<br>
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, I&rsquo;m quite fond of continuous structures at the lowest level, because  necessary successive discretization could elegantly introduce notions of approximation and uncertainty, <a href="artificial-universe-metaphysics.project.html">as mentioned in metaphysical framework</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking of a &ldquo;level of detail&rdquo; (LoD) approach, where the discretization happens according to a Process&rsquo; perspective or epistemological constraints; the discretization would be defined by relationships between Processes rather than by fixed spatial or temporal grids. Let&rsquo;s keep that aside right now, and look at some (discrete) ideas first:<br>
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2b2971c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2b2971c"><a href="#org2b2971c">Cellular Automata</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2b2971c">
<p>
Cellular automata allow for efficient parallel computation in theory, because each cell&rsquo;s state depends only on its local neighboorhood, and their states are updated simultaneously.<br>
</p>

<p>
But cellular automata may not fit all too well to the Protoverse; at least not directly, because cellular automata are pretty low-level, and their expressiveness is inherently tied to discrete steps, a rigid a-priori concept of uniform time progression and locality.<br>
</p>

<p>
Well, that could be migitated by the rules &#x2013; it solely depends on how many layers of abstraction we are willing to pile up on another. Put differently, it would be necessary to design a higher-level DSL that compiles down to cellular automaton rulesets. But given that &#x2013; what&rsquo;s the point using a cellular automata in the first place?<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge28248d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge28248d"><a href="#orge28248d">Dynamic Graphs, Hypergraph</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge28248d">
<p>
Hypergraphs offer higher flexibility to encode also non-local relations and interactions. Eventually, one would not just use &ldquo;a hypergraph&rdquo;, but utilize evolving substructures to encode evolutionary dynamics. Graphs lend themselves to recursive and fractal-like structures, which corresponds to modeling Nested Scales of Complexity.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2c685a1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2c685a1"><a href="#org2c685a1">Higher-order Functions and Function Composition</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2c685a1">
<p>
The idea here is to put aside structures like cellular automata and hypergraphs, but use just functions for dynamically evolving structures. That&rsquo;s pretty wild and requires careful design. Eentually, we may end up with some kind of a graph anyway (or an unintelligible mess), because we&rsquo;re just abstracting the notion of structure into the behavior of functions themselves.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2f4ea4e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2f4ea4e"><a href="#org2f4ea4e">Language Oriented Programming (LOP)</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2f4ea4e">
<p>
The idea here is to have a language representation that is subject to be utilized and evolved directly by the Protoverse Processes (&ldquo;data is code, code is data&rdquo;). <i>Everything</i> then would happen at the language level, abstracting from stuff like functions, data structures, graphs, etc. That would certainly add semantic denseness, and brings a clear distinction between high-level design and lower-level implementation. The feedback loop involving design and implementation would have to be very tight, otherwise issues could show up that lead to frequent pivots.<br>

<h4 id="org9c68578"><a href="#org9c68578">Adopt, Adapt or Design a Process Calculus</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9c68578">
<p>
A newcomer on this list and my favorite: As per my current understanding, designing the Process abstraction and dynamics would result in something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus">process calculus</a> anyway, just &ldquo;ad hoc, informally specified, bug-ridden and half-assed&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m aware that process calculi are considered models of computation &ldquo;for concurreny&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s just one (albeit convenient) aspect &#x2013; in this context, it&rsquo;s even more interesting is that process calculi are existing formal systems to express process dynamics, and it seems that they are used to model dynamics in biology.<br>
</p>

<p>
The idea behind process calculi seems quite appealing, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">π-calculus</a>: there are <i>anonymous processes</i> that communicate via named (or typed) channels. These channels can be passed around by processes through other channels, and this &ldquo;mobility&rdquo; allows dynamic reconfiguration of the process network. Processes can be composed into larger ones, which maps nicely to the idea of &ldquo;higher-order&rdquo; Protoverse Processes. Typed channels might represent various &ldquo;dimensions&rdquo; for newly evolved means of relations (and interactions) of higher-order Processes.<br>
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a chance that I might conflate something and be mistaken with what I said above, since I&rsquo;ve looked into process calculi only superficially as of yet. Before deep-diving, it seems rather sensible to advance the design of the Process abstraction by own reasoning first, and reconcile afterwards.<br>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org14cf429" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org14cf429"><a href="#org14cf429">Bigraphs (Robin Milner)</a></h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org14cf429">
<p>
Today I learned that the idea of using channels as &ldquo;dimensions&rdquo; is central to  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigraph">bigraphs</a></i>, which are considered a generalization of the π-Calculus. Bigraphs consist of two distinct but connected graphs: one modeling the connectivity between processes (communication links) and the other modeling their placement within a spatial or hierarchical context (location).<br>
</p>

<p>
My intuition suggests that this would be equivalent to using two typed channels, one representing the hierarchical context and the other representing connectivity. Such a typed approach could accommodate more than just two dimensions. However, I might be confusing things here; the key point seems to be that Robin Milner explicitly defined the formal specification and interactions for each of these two connected graphs, which provides a rigurous formal model.<br>

The following requirements are roughly sorted from most immediate neccesity to long-term concerns (optimizations):<br>

<h3 id="orgeab85cb"><a href="#orgeab85cb">Modus Operandi</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeab85cb">
<p>
What type of application will it become? Each approach calls for different development styles, choice of language and platform, different analysis methods, maintenance- and scaling strategies, and a plethora of other requirements.<br>
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9aa5dac" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9aa5dac"><a href="#org9aa5dac">Batch-processing</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9aa5dac">
<p>
An exponentially growing Protoverse could translate into a &ldquo;big-bang&rdquo; computation that runs for a few minutes or hours, with runtime- and subsequent analysis. The batch-processing approach could also be a &ldquo;big bang/crunch&rdquo; model: a snapshot of the state is going to be pruned, written to the database, and then fed into the next run. This approach is conceptually simple, contained and portable: we could optimize the entire run as a single, closed computation, potentially leveraging computing resources more efficiently. But it might be likely too simple to be viable: Even though self-contained, complexity is growing anyway. This approach doesn&rsquo;t encourage resource management, but ignores it; The length of the development cycle (develop-compile-load-run-save-analyze) will become increasingly lengthy, slowing down the iteration process.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgbf4c02e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbf4c02e"><a href="#orgbf4c02e">Long-running</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbf4c02e">
<p>
A long-running app might be much more interesting: real-time interaction and observation becomes possible, and there&rsquo;s inherent encouragement for fine-grained state- and resource-management from the beginning. The development cycle could be kept short. Computing resources must be continuously available. The infrastructure will introduce additional overhead, in terms of performance and development effort.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0120365" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0120365"><a href="#org0120365">Conclusion</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0120365">
<p>
Given the nature of the Protoverse as a platform for exploring process-relational dynamics and evolution, the long-running, real-time system seems more aligned with practical goals. This approach facilitates a closer relationship between the developer and the Protoverse, embodying the co-evolutionary aspect of the conceptual framework.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, early stages or specific experiments within the Protoverse could benefit from the simplicity and control offered by batch processing, especially for testing hypotheses or performing intensive computations that are self-contained.<br>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org88d7f1e">
<p>
The primary langage should enable expressing the fundamental dynamics as closely and naturally as possible in order to minimixe context-switching. An expressive, high-level, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming">functional</a> programming language with metaprogramming, maybe in combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a> seems a good fit.<br>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge7df9ac">
<p>
However, it seems unlikely to achieve a close fit of metaphysics and code with a general-purpose programming language alone. It might be reasonable to leverage syntactic abstractions to a larger extend (e.g. a DSL resembling some form of process calculus). Pivoting quickly into different directions must be feasible (emphasis on refactoring capabilities and rather general primitives).<br>

<h3 id="orgbf068f6"><a href="#orgbf068f6">Exploratory Programming</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbf068f6">
<p>
There will be no distinct formal specification of the Protoverse model (or put differently, the code will be the specification), hence an exploratory programming style seems like the sanest approach to model the Protoverse dynamics. That sets the focus on primarily interactive use of a language or computing environment.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="org0bffcf8"><a href="#org0bffcf8">Conversational Programming</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0bffcf8">
<p>
The benefit hinges on the anticipated modus operandi of the Protoverse:<br>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Batch-processing: This approach would make live-coding abilities not a requirement. We would be free to compile down to machine code and use a statically typed language, where the strict distinction between programming time, compile time and run time wouldn&rsquo;t be a hindrance.<br></li>
<li>Long-running: The Protoverse as an application that reconfigures itself continuosly leans inherently towards being stateful. It calls for interaction and live-coding at the running system as the primary way of development and maintenance.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>
The help of a VM- or image-based runtime and language that allows to experiment with the system and to tweak it at runtime would greatly enhance understanding and development efficiency. Unfortunately, this rules out statically typed languages because of their sharp distinctions between programming time, compile time and run time.<br>
</p>

<p>
Since the interesting stuff is likely to happen the longer the Protoverse runs, the ability to step back and forth through the execution history might be desired, too (straightforward state-recreation, or actually circumventing the need for state recreation to begin with).<br>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgda41586">
<p>
A lot of stuff is going to happen in realtime. Eventually I&rsquo;m expecting several billions of smallish, interacting computations. In the early stages, where the focus is on modeling the Process abstraction and dynamics, the capacity to handle a couple of millions will be enough, which is achievable on a small Rasperry Pi cluster or even a bunch of laptops.<br>

<h4 id="org2d83556"><a href="#org2d83556">Concurrency</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2d83556">
<p>
Since massive concurrency is a basic need, this will practically rule out concurrency solely based on native threads scheduled by the OS kernel.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are basically two facilities in common use that fit massive concurrency: Either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a> or CSP-style channels (<a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2016/10/12/an-incomplete-history-of-language-facilities-for-concurrency">breakdown here</a>). My first idea was that the primitive Protoverse Processes and user-level threads are mapped one-to-one, where the user-level threads are then multiplexed to OS-threads. Here is to note that Protoverse Processes compose into higher-order Processes, which leads to and relies on relations (state) and communication between the underlying runtime threads.<br>

<h5 id="orga7170a2"><a href="#orga7170a2">Actor Model vs. Process Calculi</a></h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga7170a2">
<p>
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus">Process calculi</a></b> are interesting for the sake of pondering about Process dynamics, as they are languages for modeling concurrent computation.<br>
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a range of process calculi: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">π-calculus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-calculus">Join calculus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_calculus">Ambient calculus</a> (related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_membranes">membranes</a>) and several others. I think the π-calculus and Join Calculus are particularly interesting (maybe due to the fact that I didn&rsquo;t look into others as much).<br>
</p>

<p>
As far as I know there are no &ldquo;production-ready&rdquo; performant languages that implement π-calculus. However, there are at least two Join-calculus implementations: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoCaml">JoCaml</a> (in OCaml) and <a href="https://github.com/Chymyst/chymyst-core/">Chymyst</a> (in Scala, chemical machine) &#x2013; both abanoned. More common are CSP implementations though (Communicating Sequential Processes), e.g. Clojure&rsquo;s core.async or Go&rsquo;s go-routines; but even though CSP is conceptually related, its capabilities are quite different as CSP lacks the dynamic parts that makes π-calculus and Join-calculus interesting modeling tools.<br>
</p>

<p>
The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a></b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model_and_process_calculi">differs from process calculi</a> in several aspects, for instance actors are based on the idea of individual entities; they are not anonymous, but messages are adressed via unique identifiers. The Actor Model is &ldquo;modeled after physics&rdquo; (or an understanding thereof) and very identity-centered, which runs strongly against the process-relational <a href="artificial-universe-metaphysics.project.html">Protoverse metaphysics</a>, where &ldquo;identity&rdquo; is a rather fluid concept.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, we could implement something resembling π-calculus or Join-calculus by a thin layer on top of an existing actor model implementation &#x2013; interestingly, that has been done before: see <a href="https://github.com/rhumbertgz/jerlang">JErlang</a>, which implements Join-calculus. Such an implementation based on the yet-to-design Protoverse specifcs could then serve as a DSL to express the Protoverse Process dynamics; essentially a multiscale abstract machine.<br>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org94fb32b">
<p>
The Proptoverses model&rsquo;s focus is on relational dynamics, recursive algorithms (e.g. manipulation of nested hypergraphs) to model potentially infinite Nested Scales of Complexity. Protoverse dynamics are supposed to be largely irregular, highly interconnected (not strictly hierarchical).<br>
</p>

<p>
This seems to align well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_parallelism">task parallelism</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism">data parallelism</a>. However, data parallelism is more more widespread in use today and generally more efficient (e.g. SIMD). Hence it&rsquo;s worth considering if parts of the dynamics could be computed in a data-parallel approach, e.g. vectorization.<br>
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, encapsulation and locality are good indicators for how effectively computations can be parallelized. What strategies in regard to parallelization deal specifically well with deeply nested structures/dynamics?<br>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For deeply nested and interconnected structures, a hybrid approach might be beneficial.<br>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use task parallelism to manage the high-level structure and irregular tasks.<br></li>
<li>Apply data-parallel techniques on subcomponents of the problem where data can be processed uniformly.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recursive tasks can sometimes be decomposed into smaller problems where data parallelism can be exploited, especially if parts of the computation manifest regular patterns or repeated operations.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>
In any case, it makes sense to have straightforward GPU computing available (OpenCL or CUDA).<br>

<p>
Deep recursion is going to play a key role (evolutionary dynamics at multiple Nested Scales of Complexity). Specifically, more complex recursive algorithms who use the intermediate values returned by successive recursive calls cannot be expressed via recursion in tail-call position.<br>
</p>

<p>
Hence, it would be great to have an unlimited or dynamically managed call stack depth to prevent stack overflows, so that we could write recursive functions in a naive style for convenience, specifically during prototyping.<br>
</p>

<p>
If that isn&rsquo;t available, we could work around that limitation with an explicit stack, using a heap-allocated data structure. The stack management logic could be hidden with a helper macro, keeping the actual function clean.<br>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve got a feeling that infinite structures for data representation (open-endedness) might be naturally pervasive in the Protoverse, and dealing with them easily would simplyfy certain things. This may require non-strict evaluation (laziness), either by default or opt-in (preferred), depending on how much hinges on infinite structures.<br>

<p>
The concept of &ldquo;observer dependency&rdquo; (which is part of the metaphysic participatory universe) could be understood that the state of a Process is not determined (computed) until it is &ldquo;observed&rdquo; &#x2013; <i>observation as evaluation</i> or observational computation (not to confuse with the &ldquo;Gang of Four&rdquo; observer pattern, which is something else).<br>
</p>

<p>
The analogy becomes stronger, if we assume our universe is somehow &ldquo;computational&rdquo;. It seems like deferring the resolution of quantum states is similar to how a computer defers computations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy evaluation</a>. Although the analogy is not really correct, both concepts deal with the transition from potential to actual states, implying that states are determined as needed, rather than being predetermined and statically defined.<br>

Theoretically, might turn out practical to follow such an approach to save computing resources; but it might also turn out extremely impractical (piling up thunks). Any way, it deserves consideration and further thought.<br>

It might turn out beneficial if a bigger language ecosystem is within reach, either by directly building on that very ecosystem/platform, or via straightforward interop with others.

We probably have to consider memory-saving techniques earlier in the development process; also taking into consideration, how much of Protoverse history will have to be kept around. We have to consider if a Markovian approach (history-less) would be possible, and where.<br>
</p>

<p>
Clever resource-saving plays a larger role if he Protoverse would be a long-running application. There could be intrinsic selection (as a part of the Protoverse dynamics) that effectively prunes certain Nested Scales Of Complexity when it is highly probable that nothing interesting happens at these; e.g. when they turn out random and too boring and therefore &ldquo;non-viable&rdquo;. On the other side &#x2013; even inconspicuous, boring dynamics can turn out to be further influential for evolution, and the extent may be unforeseeable.<br>

<p>
First and foremost, the prevalent status will be &ldquo;under development&rdquo;; and increasing resource counsumption. Therefore easy scaling should be baked-in from the beginning. It depends on the principal modus operandi of the Protoverse which scaling model to prefer:<br>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Batch-processing: This approach leans toward vertical scaling, throwing more powerful hardware on it, e.g. CPU/GPU arrays. This hardware doesn&rsquo;t have to be available all the time.<br></li>
<li>Long-running: The Protoverse as a continuously running application could benefit from a horizontal, distributed scaling model. Permanent access to the hardware infrastructure is required.<br></li>

And concerning the language, well &#x2026; most likely Elixir, because it ticks most of the boxes, even though I find Elxir rather clumsy &#x2013; syntax-wise for once, and also due to the function scoping, and having separate namespaces for functions and variables (&ldquo;Lisp 2&rdquo;) which is an Erlang heritage. Erlang solves that quite elegantly by just using ariable names who start with a capital. That should have been fixed &#x2013; I mean it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;functional&rdquo; language, but it&rsquo;s getting really messy with higher-order functions.<br>

<p>
So it will be quite reasonable to implement an MVP of the core abstraction in at least 3 languages, beginning with the most expressive, prototyping-friendly one. But before I can indulge in that, I&rsquo;ll have to design the core abstraction (Protoverse Process) reasonably far enough.<br>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I should start to explore using one of the Schemes, either Guile or Gerbil.<br></li>

<li>Then, I&rsquo;m ready to consider the BEAM languages Elixir and LFE, in orer to check if the BEAM actually can provide a suitable platform to build on.<br></li>

<li>And as a third, it&rsquo;s worth considering Haskell and OCaml. Both of them provide suitable facilities, like STM (Haskell) and algebraic effects (OCaml), even though both are not party-hard interactive.<br></li>
