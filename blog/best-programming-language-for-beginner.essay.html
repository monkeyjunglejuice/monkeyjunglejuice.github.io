<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3f3dc72">
<p>
&ldquo;Learning a programming language&rdquo; is what applies foremost to programmers who already know how to program. For them, picking up a new language is possible within a couple of weeks (and for you too, once you&rsquo;ve gained some experience), and it does&rsquo;t matter really that much which one &#x2013; because the patterns how to accomplish most things are roughly overlapping.<br>
</p>

<p>
But if you start out, you don&rsquo;t need to just learn a programming language. <b>First, you want to learn how to program</b>. It means learning how to analyze a problem you want to tackle, finding a solution and express it in code, which is often not intuitive. Plus, you still have to learn a programming language with syntax and semantics, too. So that is two things at once.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org04c1d67" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org04c1d67">Your Reason to learn coding</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org04c1d67">
<p>
Do you want to prepair for a career as a software developer? There are different areas where software is developed &#x2013; the most obvious within the web, is obviously the development of the web itself. But there are other areas like fintech, aircraft systems, robotics, telecom, water supply or internet of things. If you know exactly what you intent to do, you could start with a language of your specific field and go form there. Or maybe better not?<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crucial that you understand<br>
the principles behind programming<br>
that transcend the specifics<br>
of any specific language.&rdquo;<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You should go with a language that&rsquo;s interesting to you &#x2013; for whatever reason &#x2013; and is particularly suitable for learning, according to the criteria I lay out below. Some are bad for learning, for various reasons. I&rsquo;m also going to describe the most interesting languages and their idiosyncrasies.<br>
</p>

<p>
You may want to learn programming, even if you have no plans to become a part of the software workforce, like me. I&rsquo;ve worked quite a long time as a designer and in online marketing industry, but have barely written any code at all, since there were always developers working alongside me and tasked with the wizardry.<br>
</p>

<p>
But I have always been interested in computer stuff, so I&rsquo;ve dabbled a lot with Linux, server administration and tweaking my configs as a means of procrastination. Real programming was the magical border I haven&rsquo;t crossed &#x2013; until recently.<br>
</p>

<p>
For my part, I want a tool in which I can think, and I&rsquo;d like to be able to prototype an idea if I have one. Further, I think programming can help us tremendously to develop our minds. I must say that hated mathematics in school and have been really bad at it, but I&rsquo;m fascinated and eventually I want to know what is this all about. So I had to start somewhere.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Life is short &#x2013;<br>
pull down the curtain,<br>
cast some spells<br>
and wield some magic!&rdquo;<br>

<div id="outline-container-orgb9cb4d5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb9cb4d5">What makes a programming language beginner-friendly?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb9cb4d5">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb37cd8d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb37cd8d">Available learning Material</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb37cd8d">
<p>
For which programming language is the right learning material available? This point is huge! I&rsquo;d go so far and choose a first language solely on this single criterion.<br>
</p>

<p>
Most programming books or courses are not made for absolute beginners, but for programmers who want to <i>learn another language</i>. Remember, you want to <i>learn programming</i>, not just a language (You&rsquo;re going to learn the language on the go, and it will not be your only one).<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s not that &ldquo;regular&rdquo; programming books are &ldquo;too advanced&rdquo; to grasp; it&rsquo;s just that they teach you the wrong things, instead of the things you&rsquo;ll actually need to learn.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think it would be wise to prefer material from university profs and/or other reputable personalities to make sure you adopt a well rounded foundation and good style, instead of jumping between random tutorials. The more popular the language, the more crap you&rsquo;ll run into.<br>
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s why I recommend a textbook or e-textbook <b>with exercises</b> as your main forge of knowledge, because books are still the most accessible media &#x2013; you can read a chapter even if you&rsquo;re queueing up somewhere.<br>
</p>

<p>
Prepare to dabble with your textbook for quite some time. <i>So you really want an enjoyable one!</i> The most recommended book may not neccesarily be the right one for you; individual taste matters a lot. I&rsquo;ve listed the best available programming books below with some alternatives, for each language.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5adbc66" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5adbc66">What kind of animal are you?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5adbc66">
<p>
Programming languages are created by different minds, within different eras, significantly influenced by fashion. One language may be a natural fit for a certain personality type, and a less fortunate choice for another. That even applies to programming itself &#x2013; it&rsquo;s easier for some and harder for others (doesn&rsquo;t mean those are more stupid).<br>
</p>

<p>
It seems there are two different groups of programmers. Those that see programming languages primarily as a means of production (category 1) and those who see it as instrument of human reason (categories 2 and 3):<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Pragmatic languages:</b> conservative, efficient, boring.<br>
<i>&ldquo;A programming language is a tool to get the job done&rdquo;</i><br>
(C, Java, Go)<br></li>
<li><b>Hackish languages:</b> multi-paradigm, anything goes, unopinionated.<br>
<i>&ldquo;I pursue absolute freedom and like to explore the problem domain interactively&rdquo;</i><br>
(Lisp, Scheme, Javascript)<br></li>
<li><b>Constraining languages:</b> single-paradigm, protecting you from yourself, opinionated.<br>
<i>&ldquo;I prefer one correct way according a fixed set of rules&rdquo;</i><br>
(Elm, Haskell, Python)<br></li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org385529a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org385529a">Which programming language will be in high demand</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org385529a">
<p>
… in late autumn 2026 so I can get filthy rich coding in it? Well, nobody knows and it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Why? <i>Because it&rsquo;s about learning to code</i> &#x2013; which is a timeless skill &#x2013; not about a particular language (those come and go).<br>
</p>

<p>
Programming is like being able to ride a bicycle. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the underlying principle, you won&rsquo;t die instantly when you fall over, and it will not make much of a difference if you hop on Grandma&rsquo;s grinder or shred your neighbour&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s tricycle, and it will not matter much if the current trend says in 10 years everyone is riding nothing but mountain bikes with pink tyres.<br>
</p>

<p>
But! There&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s getting more and more important. It&rsquo;s called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)">concurrency</a></i>. Most languages in use today have been developed years ago when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&rsquo;s Law</a> was still valid. Back then, everyone expected single processors getting faster and faster, so it was perfectly fine to have languages to make programs running on a single processor, and no one cared to build in concurrency features.<br>
</p>

<p>
But that is not any more. To keep up with the demands of modern applications, we have no other chance than to put more processors into a computer, or to run the application distributed on multiple computers. To leverage the power of multi-core processors, we need to be able to program our software conveniently in a way to utilize all available cores.<br>
</p>

<p>
That leads us to learn a programming language that is designed with concurrency in mind and simplifies building concurrent software.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org37c65fb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org37c65fb">Community and Popularity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org37c65fb">
<p>
Popular languages have some benefits &#x2013; for instance bigger ecosystems, which leads to many things built around the language to make the life of (experienced) programmers easier.<br>
</p>

<p>
Libraries are part of the ecosystem: those are pieces of code written by other programmers that can be re-used, so a developer has less work and doesn&rsquo;t need to code everything from scratch.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are programming languages that have strong feelings attached and attract a fanatic cult-like following, more than others. Those are Python, Haskell, and Lisp.<br>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, popular languages have also bigger communities. You don&rsquo;t need a huge community, but it should be a welcoming one. Smaller communities have their benefits, too.<br>
</p>

<p>
So, 700,000 people fullmoon rave or beach party with friends? Meh, forget both and practice some social distancing &#x2013; it&rsquo;s <del>quite popular</del> in high demand right now!<br>

<div id="outline-container-orgd46675f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd46675f">Expressive Power and Abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd46675f">
<p>
Expressivity means how simple it is to say certain things. There are a couple of factors who determine how expressive a programming language can be:<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd1205f4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd1205f4">Low-level or High-level?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd1205f4">
<p>
Low-level does not mean &ldquo;worse&rdquo; or &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; than high-level &#x2013; it just refers to the fact that computers are built in many layers on top of each other, and the levels close to the physical machine are called the &ldquo;low level&rdquo;. You could also call it &ldquo;foundation&rdquo;, if you prefer a less judgementally sounding term xP<br>
</p>

<p>
High-level languages tend to be more expressive than low-level languages, because with each layer up, the grade of <i>abstraction</i> increases and more powerful ways to express complex things come into play.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeab952a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeab952a">How simple is it to build Abstractions?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeab952a">
<p>
What is abstraction? It means hiding the foundational workings of the level(s) below (eg. the physical machine) so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with them directly and can focus on your problem/idea instead.<br>
</p>

<p>
An analogy: A console used to control the lightshow of a concert is an abstraction over fumbling with the electricity cables and tieing them together to make light bulbs glow in a certain order. Now think about doing the light show only by messing with the wires. This is dangerous and way harder (nearly impossible) than using the console. And so it is with programming, too.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org22c2451" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org22c2451">Is it a wordy or concise Language?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org22c2451">
<p>
Do you have to write a lot of boilerplate or repeat yourself? In most cases you want an expressive high-level language; not overly verbose but also not too concise, so there&rsquo;s just the right amount of redundancy left to keep it comprehensible.<br>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9b31940" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9b31940">Syntax and Consistency</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9b31940">
<p>
As a novice coder, you probably want to start out quickly, and you&rsquo;ll need enough brain capacity left to maintain focus on the important things, without the language getting in your way. So you want a simple syntax that&rsquo;s easy to pick up and remember.<br>
</p>

<p>
A thoroughly designed programming language suits well for learning, because you will encounter less surprises and pitfalls. Consistency helps you to derive further things from things you already have learned before.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0e75962" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0e75962">Maturity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0e75962">
<p>
While it may be tempting to start with the current hyped language everyone is raving about, a mature programming language has the benefit of an organically grown user base, flaws ironed out, stuff being written about it, better tooling, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>
A mature language doesn&rsquo;t change every couple of months, so you can be sure to learn the &ldquo;right&rdquo; things &#x2013; you don&rsquo;t have to worry if you&rsquo;re learning old stuff without knowing.<br>
</p>

<p>
Which language has been around for quite a while, but implements modern, interesting and useful concepts that may be relevant in the future?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5d31000" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5d31000">Tooling and Usability</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5d31000">
<p>
Your language of choice should come with tooling that&rsquo;s easy to use. It includes things like editor support (syntax highlighting, &ldquo;jump-to-definition&rdquo;, looking up documentation), helpful (or at least comprehensible) error messages, and package management for libraries.<br>
</p>

<p>
A good selection of libraries is desirable for industrial use, but doesn&rsquo;t matter sooo much in the beginning. Some languages can even use libraries from other programming languages / ecosystems, and go even further than that.<br>
</p>

<p>
Consider to pick a language that comes with a <i>REPL</i>, sometimes called <i>console</i> or <i>toplevel</i>. That&rsquo;s basically like the command line running in a terminal emulator, but instead of shell commands you can run single pieces of your code. Well, nowadays many languages come with a REPL. But some go even further than that and enable true <i>interactive development</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Can you get started without fumbling for days?<br>

<h2 id="orgd108d46">Choose your Poison</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd108d46">
<p>
Here is a carefully picked selection of interesting programming languages. Some of them are better teaching languages, while others are worse.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2cf000a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2cf000a">ANSI C</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2cf000a">
<p>
Welcome to the low-level. Programs written in C tend to be much more performant than programs written in other languages. In other words, it is the fastest (practical) programming language. Performance-critical algorithms and other parts of applications are usually written in C; e. g. the Linux kernel, drivers, high-performance libraries, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>
There seems to be a tradeoff with programming languages:<br>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>either high run-time performance (fast) plus low programmer productivity → longer development time<br></li>
<li>or lower run-time performance (slow) but higher programmer productivity → shorter development time<br></li>
</ul>

<p>
Development time (human) is more expensive than run-time time (computer), so mostly we agree on a slower programming language to minimize the human effort. However, since performance is a matter of implementation, not the programming language per se, this is not entirely true. There are programming languages coming close to C performance, one example is <a href="#org1b6362b">Julia</a><br>
</p>

<p>
You may hear here and there that C is the foundation for everything and everyone must learn programming in C before even thinking about anything else &#x2013; but no, don&rsquo;t waste your time: Learn C if you have a genuine interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming">systems programming</a> or another reason to work very close to the machine.<br>
</p>

<p>
If that is the case, and you wanna become a hardware hacker, you may also look into the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction">Arduino electronics platform</a>, coming with the Arduino programming language (which is basically a subset of C). Don&rsquo;t confuse C with C++ (an extension to C, but huge and messy) or C# (a Microsoft thing). <i>Look for &ldquo;ANSI C&rdquo;</i> &#x2013; the standard.<br>

<h3 id="org697d44e">Lua</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org697d44e">
<p>
On the surface, Lua is quite similar to JavaScript &#x2013; just without the ugly parts (more about that later). Lua is elegant, performant, carefully designed and consistent. Therefore it is super easy to learn for <del>Muggles</del> Non-programmers, and probably the &ldquo;easiest&rdquo; programming language listed here.<br>
</p>

<p>
The language is mainly used in the game industry (e. g. World of Warcraft, Roblox). Lua goes very well with C and it can be embedded into C code, so that high-level program logic &#x2013; like character behavior &#x2013; can be scripted in Lua, while the other parts of the software in need for raw metal speed can be written in C or C++.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lua can be used everywhere and it&rsquo;s quite simple to get started and build something with it: You might want to make your own 2D game with the Löve game engine, you can use it to code native games and other apps for Android. There&rsquo;s a really nice IDE (&ldquo;Integrated Development Environment&rdquo;) for Lua programming, called &ldquo;ZeroBrane Studio&rdquo;; think of it as an extended editor especially for Lua.<br>
</p>

<p>
As far as I know, there are not many textbooks available, but you can use <i>the</i> comprehensive book written by Lua&rsquo;s chief architect Roberto Ierusalimschy. And there&rsquo;s a wiki and many many user tutorials. Lua is primarily developed at the University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). Once you&rsquo;ve commited to learn Lua, I recommend to buy the 4th edition to support the development.<br>

<h3 id="org11a9ca0">Clojure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org11a9ca0">
<p>
As a total noob, I&rsquo;ve been looking for a language with a simple syntax, because who wants to run into syntax errors all the time? Clojure is a member of the <i>Lisp</i> family; those have the cleanest syntax of all programming languages. Further, it seems to be the most expressive general purpose language, and it&rsquo;s designed especially with concurrency in mind.<br>
</p>

<p>
The language is built on top of the Java platform. Software built on Java can run on almost any major operating system &#x2013; Windows, Linux, Mac, etc. Clojure can be used for different things, even for artsy stuff. Just as an example: <a href="https://overtone.github.io/">you can do live coding and make algorithmic music</a>, and there are things like algo-raves (yup, that exists &#x2026;).<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also a practical language to build serious business software with, because it can use Java&rsquo;s library ecosystem. And there&rsquo;s <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>, a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript (so you you won&rsquo;t have to write web apps in JavaScript).<br>
</p>

<p>
But there&rsquo;s that Java underbelly who sticks out everywhere, coming with it&rsquo;s own terminology. And that&rsquo;s the drawback that makes it quite unsuitable as a first language: You&rsquo;ll have to jump into the Java abyss eventually and learn that stuff to understand the Clojure docs and error messages, distracting you from your mission to learn programming and making it unneccessarily complicated.<br>

If you want to try it anyway, I recommend the book &ldquo;Clojure for the Brave and True&rdquo;; it had given me a few enlightening moments how all the parts interlock: functions taking functions and spitting out functions, like interlocking parts of a imaginary robot factory building little machines building little machines &#x2026; But I think that&rsquo;s more a property of functional-first languages in general. The book convinced me also to take a look at Emacs.<br>

<h3 id="org86f94a6">Scheme and Racket</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org86f94a6">
<p>
Pleasantly surprised by Clojure, I&rsquo;ve looked up other languages from the Lisp family. Scheme is commonly recommended to beginners, and those who are serious about computer science. It&rsquo;s a bit opinionated to be unopinionated, and Scheme minimalist (no distraction) and often considered as the most elegant and consistent programming language in existence. Therefore it is excellent for learning.<br>
</p>

<p>
Racket is a descendant of Scheme (it was called PLT Scheme before). It is &ldquo;Scheme with batteries included&rdquo;, a platform for research and to create other programming languages. Scheme can run on Racket, so even if you just want to learn the Scheme language, you can do it comfortably in Racket. That may sound a bit confusing, but it actually isn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll see.<br>
</p>

<p>
Further, Racket emphasizes &ldquo;language oriented programming&rdquo;. It means you can design your own small (domain specific) programming languages for your application and then write your application in that language. But you don&rsquo;t have to &#x2013; you can just use &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Racket like everyone else. So don&rsquo;t bother with that for now.<br>
</p>

<p>
The most recommended book on (functional) programming is the timeless classic &ldquo;Structure and Interpretation of Programming Languages&rdquo;, abbreviatet &ldquo;SICP&rdquo;. It was written as an introduction for computer science students at MIT, using Scheme. But for me it was too much as a very first book on programming. But check it out anyway, it&rsquo;s really philosophical.<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve also started to read &ldquo;How to Design Programs&rdquo;, which is supposedly easier and often recommended to read before SICP, but found it earnest and dry. The other books are quite different. Personally I recommend &ldquo;Simply Scheme&rdquo;, &ldquo;Realm of Racket&rdquo; (the most entertaining) and &ldquo;The Little Schemer&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
You can get started very easily with Scheme and Racket &#x2013; one single install and go, no matter if you are on Windows, Linux or Mac. You don&rsquo;t even have to be familiar with the command line, because it comes with DrRacket, a friendly and easy to use programming environment (IDE).<br>

<h3 id="orgc84a8f2">Common Lisp</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc84a8f2">
<p>
The first reason for me to use a programming language wasn&rsquo;t coding, actually I wanted a better calculator. A REPL makes a way better calculator than the silly concept of an interface resembling a physical pocket calculator with big buttons and a single line display.<br>
</p>

<p>
Well, here Lisp&rsquo;s functional notation felt really weird for doing arithmetik: Instead of <code>10 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7</code> you write <code>(+ 10 3 4 6 7)</code>. There are no operatiors, it&rsquo;s basically all function application. All Lisp languages have this uniform and simple syntax. It makes a couple of things easier, for instance to write programs who write programs who &#x2026; well, that&rsquo;s for later. The syntax is easy to remember so it doesn&rsquo;t get in your way, and you can concentrate on the things that really matter.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think the most compelling books and essays have been written on Lisp, and it has the best learning material I could find. Well, Lisp has been around for a while.<br>
</p>

<p>
What really fascinates me, is that Lisp is no &ldquo;black box&rdquo;, where you write some keywords and then something underneath does some things and you don&rsquo;t know what and why. Lisp is different: It is built on a few simple pieces, and everything else is built from those pieces &#x2013; it is transparent and easy to paint a mental picture how it actually works.<br>
</p>

<p>
The tooling is excellent and designed for interactive development. <b>There&rsquo;s a really nice <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cl-repl/id1511296102">App for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eql5.android.repl">Android</a> called &ldquo;CL REPL&rdquo;.</b> You can use it to tinker around when ever you feel like <i>&ldquo;Damn, I wish I could write some Lisp right now!&rdquo;</i> You can. It&rsquo;s in fact a complete Common Lisp IDE with SLIME, the &ldquo;Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
But usually you want it on your laptop. I recommend Emacs with SLIME, and it&rsquo;s easy to install: <a href="https://portacle.github.io/">use Portacle</a>, which has everything bundled together with batteries included. If you don&rsquo;t know Emacs yet, do:<br>
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Menu → &ldquo;Options&rdquo; → &ldquo;Use CUA keys&rdquo;<br></li>
<li>Menu → &ldquo;Options&rdquo; → &ldquo;Save options&rdquo;<br></li>
</ol>
<p>
&#x2013; then copy &amp; paste works like everywhere else.<br>

<h3 id="org4d44d5f">Erlang and Elixir</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4d44d5f">
<p>
Erlang the platform is an integral building block of today&rsquo;s telecommunication networks. Your mobile provider&rsquo;s infrastructure runs likely on Erlang, and so does WhatsApp. Erlang is not just a programming language, but a complex framework to write forever-running network applications; you can even think of it as an operating system. The whole point behind Erlang is to build long-running, fault-tolerant systems. So it&rsquo;s all about error handling and staying online.<br>
</p>

<p>
To achive that, Erlang leverages concurrency through an interesting concept, the <a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">actor model</a>. That makes Elang platform a natural fit for mission-critical infrastructure, decentralized computing, peer-to-peer networking, messaging apps and servers with hundreds of thousands of simultaneous active users, internet of things … Ok ok, I see you got it.<br>
</p>

<p>
Erlang the language and Elixir are just two languages to write applications for the Erlang platform (there are others as well, eg. <a href="https://lfe.io/">LFE</a>). Erlang (ERicsson LANGuage) is the original language. It is pragmatic, compact and easy to pick up. Erlang the language has better/mature tooling, too.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elixir on the other hand is an alternative syntax plus some additional concepts like macros (metaprogramming). What I dislike about Elixir: Many constructs have 3-4 &ldquo;shorthands&rdquo; to write the same thing. How annoying! It seems the language designers couldn&rsquo;t decide what to keep and what to throw out. Elixir looks a bit wordy and incoherent, forced into a Ruby appearance (that&rsquo;s another programming language) to make it appealing for Ruby web developers. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html">Here&rsquo;s a comparison between the two languages.</a><br>
</p>

<p>
Does it make sense to learn programming with Erlang or Elixir? Well, there is not really learning material available that makes use of those languages. You&rsquo;ll find only introductions to the languages themselves (the ones I&rsquo;ve listed below), so you&rsquo;d miss the point.<br>
</p>

<p>
And there is also the Erlang technology. Like with other hosted languages (Clojure on Java, Elm on JavaScript), the additional stuff coming with it may be a bit too distracting. So if you want to learn Erlang or Elixir, you should have a good reason or two to mess with the Erlang system. <a href="https://adoptingerlang.org/docs/development/otp_high_level/">For a better idea what the Erlang platform is, check this out</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Erlang or Elixir or both? I&rsquo;d say start with Erlang and learn the platform on the way, because the Erlang platform is explained in terms of Erlang the language, not in terms of Elixir. Elixir adds additional stuff on top of that, so you may approach it afterwards, if you see need.<br>

<h3 id="orgbe9a3ec">JavaScript</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbe9a3ec">
<p>
With JavaScript, you can build all kind of things in the browser and show it to your internet friends, without having them to download or install anything. JavaScript is the only language browsers support directly, still &#x2013; and that&rsquo;s why everybody and their dog&rsquo;s fleas are coding JavaScript.<br>
</p>

<p>
The language has good tooling and is easy to start with, and you may have heard &ldquo;all you need is a web browser and a text editor&rdquo;. Well, um, no. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not really the truth. Expect a lot exceptions, special cases and to work around the poor language design. I hate incoherence, and JavaScript is the epitome of exactly that.<br>
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;ll need to learn to avoid and remember all the pitfalls, and using a <a href="https://eslint.org/">linter</a> (that&rsquo;s a tool that checks your code and tells you where the problematic or deprecated parts are) is mandatory to prevent you from using probably harmful things and deprecated stuff.<br>
</p>

<p>
Overall, it&rsquo;s a verbose frankenstein language that&rsquo;s a pain to read. Of course there are the usual suspects who disagree and even &ldquo;love&rdquo; JavaScript. These are the people who either don&rsquo;t know any better, or who suffer from a variant of the Stockholm Syndrome. Honestly, that doesn&rsquo;t make it a good choice for a first time programmer, but despite the fact, many start to learn programming with JavaScript, unfortunally.<br>
</p>

<p>
JavaScript <del>is</del> was an imperative language at the very heart, but you can write object-oriented and functional style too. JavaScript assimilates new features with each version and therefore it&rsquo;s getting bigger and bigger. Resistance is futile. Or is it?<br>
</p>

<p>
If you just wanna build web apps or browser games, you do have other choices &#x2013; check out ClojureScript (scroll up) or Elm down below &#x2013; eventually you need to know JavaScript, but maybe not as your first language.<br>

<div id="outline-container-org187f88c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org187f88c">Elm</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org187f88c">
<p>
Elm is a language that compiles to JavaScript: You write your website&rsquo;s code in Elm, and then the Elm compiler writes the JavaScript for you, so that your web browser can run it.<br>
</p>

<p>
If that sounds like it makes no sense, think about it this way: All programming languages compile down to another language on a lower level anyway, and those again and again, until your code&rsquo;s representation is only 11010101. Elm is just another layer on top.<br>
</p>

<p>
Why not writing JavaScript directly? Elm comes with a few interesting features: first and foremost a <i>static type system</i> (like Haskell), which helps you to feel (more) sure about the correctness of your code (think: less undiscovered bugs). And you don&rsquo;t have to deal with JavaScripts screwed type coercion. Secondly, Elm supports the functional programming paradigm: That makes it&rsquo;s easier to reason about what code actually does. And it comes with <i>immmutable values</i> (Ever writhed in disgust when you saw <code>x = x + 1</code>? Then this is for you).<br>
</p>

<p>
The Elm syntax is simple and the Elm compiler famous for its helpful error messages &#x2013; like a built-in teacher who pushes you gently into the right direction on your path to statically typed functional programming. And you will learn one way how to structure your application: &ldquo;The Elm Architecture&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s why I consider Elm well suited for learning, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s still a very young and domain-specifig language that runs exclusively in the browser. There is not much literature out there, but Elm opens the door to other statically typed functional languages, like OCaml or Haskell.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elm comes with an easy installation and coherent tooling. It is designed as a cathedral and quite opinionated: You&rsquo;ll need to do most things like intended by the creators, similar to Python. But that has benefits too, and it may be one of the reasons why everything within the Elm ecosystem fits so well together.<br>

<h3 id="org58af51f">Haskell</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org58af51f">
<p>
Many of Elm&rsquo;s ideas come from Haskell. So here we are. If I like Elm but it&rsquo;s a browser-only language, why not learn &ldquo;the real thing&rdquo;?<br>
</p>

<p>
Haskell has a <a href="https://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-syntax/">simple syntax</a>, but it&rsquo;s uncommon for programmers that are ingrained with the verbose syntax of C/Java/PHP/JavaScript. However, Haskell&rsquo;s syntax relies a lot on cryptic infix operators (also custom ones) and with it come things like the precendece of those operators (from 0-9). The same things can be achived by many ways in Haskell, back-and-forth.<br>
</p>

<p>
Contrary to popular belief, basic Haskell is easy to learn; especially for a person who has never programmed before. It may be less easy for experienced programmers because of all the preconceptions they have about programming. But it&rsquo;s not a compact language and Haskellers tend to be clever, so they like to use the advanced features the language and its extensions have to offer. It will get complicated very soon when you&rsquo;ll want to work with libraries and encounter code from others.<br>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not so straightforward to get started with Haskell. Downloading the compiler and starting <i>ghci</i> (the REPL) to evaluate some expressions is no big deal of course, and to compiling some code neither. But if you go a bit further and want some more convenience and install libraries, there are a couple of different approaches which tooling set to use, and they overlap in functionality, and &#x2026; I think that&rsquo;s really confusing.<br>
</p>

<p>
Not all hope is lost: If you are just interested in functional programming, you&rsquo;re better off to start with Ocaml (see below) or even Elm, both are better languages to learn. You can still move on to Haskell later, if you feel like. If you wanna give it a shot nevertheless, download <i>Stack</i> and then install everything else via Stack.<br>

<p>
The &ldquo;(Objective) Categorical Abstract Machine Language&rdquo; is used in places where performance and correctness are of utter importance, like financial technology. Two companies heavily invested in OCaml are Jane Street and Facebook.<br>
</p>

<p>
OCaml is similar to Elm and Haskell: statically typed and emphasizing functional programming. It has less ideological ballast and is more practical than Haskell, but (still) less popular. Put another way, you could also say Haskell is overly hyped. As I see it, the language seems to be due for a rise in popularity. OCaml got a lot of support within the last time. The tooling is already way better than than Haskell&rsquo;s, and there are many improvements on the way.<br>
</p>

<p>
The user experience is really nice on Linux, and OCaml works well on Windows with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</a>, too. You may run into an issue during the installing process in WSL because of WSL&rsquo;s limitations; anyway, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/12050#issuecomment-393478072">there&rsquo;s a workaround</a> for that.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think syntax matters &#x2013; for beginners especially in terms of not getting in your way. It looks clean and doesn&rsquo;t have those {curly braces} spreading all over the place, which is nice. OCaml is a bit more verbose than Haskell, but still very readable. OCaml further opens the door to F# (F Sharp), which is essentially an OCaml clone by Microsoft that runs on the .NET platform.<br>

<h3 id="orgecdf459">Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgecdf459">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve considered learning Python a couple of years ago, but after some research I found other languages far more elegant and interesting. It is one of the most used languages right now, amongst JavaScript and C. Popularity is probably Python&rsquo;s biggest benefit. So if there&rsquo;s something programmable, like say, some cheap consumer drone, then it&rsquo;s likely programmable in Python.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are Python libraries for everything, which adds to popularity. On the technical site, many of those libraries are actually written in other languages (e.g. C or C++) for performance reasons, because Python itself is by far the slowest of the languages listed here.<br>
</p>

<p>
Python has got helpful error messages and great marketing, so everyone is learning Python right now (as of 2021). The syntax looks clean and readable, almost like broken English. It&rsquo;s said to be an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; language, but I don&rsquo;t think so. Python paints you in the object-oriented corner with all the complexity that comes with it, while it makes functional programming cumbersome (which is arguably the simpler programming paradigm, from my beginner&rsquo;s perspective).<br>
</p>

<p>
Python is opinionated: The creators encourage that certain things should (only) be done in &ldquo;the right way&rdquo; &#x2013; which they call &rsquo;pythonic&rsquo;. The opposite is &rsquo;unpythonic&rsquo;. &ldquo;To describe something as &lsquo;clever&rsquo; is not considered a compliment in the Python culture&rdquo;. Well, you may be more pragmatic and don&rsquo;t care, but I think a beginner should not lock his mind into &rsquo;the pythonic way&rsquo; but start with a language that opens the mind. If you want a scripting language which is compact, even easier to learn and really fast, you may have some fun with <a href="#org697d44e">Lua</a>.<br>

<h3 id="org1b6362b">Julia</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1b6362b">
<p>
Julia is developed as a high performance vehicle for technical and scientific computing, like data science, simulations, as an alternative to Fortran, R, Python and other languages in the field.<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s still a young language, but pushed by a couple of organizations. So there&rsquo;s more of an ecosystem than you would expect for a language in that early state. Most scientists already how to program their stuff, so don&rsquo;t expect much introduction material for total beginners right now.<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve considered to learn Julia because there are some interesting aspects, but to me I see no purpose to learn it right now and therefore didn&rsquo;t look that much into it. With Julia you can do some things that you can do with Lisp, but contrary to Lisp, Julia neither uses prefix-notation syntax nor nested parantheses.<br>
</p>

<p>
Julia looks friendly and easy to start with, and you should definitely check it out if you&rsquo;re a student have to do with statistics, numerical computing or want to plot some stuff (<a href="#org86f94a6">Racket</a> shines here, too). I think Julia could be a very promising general-purpose language.<br>

<b>Choose well, but don&rsquo;t obsess too much about it:</b> I&rsquo;ve already done that part for you! You are going to learn a couple more programming languages after your first one, so it&rsquo;s not a lifetime decision, even if you feel like that now.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some courses and books teach programming using stripped-down teaching languages, or even pseudocode. I think it&rsquo;s not a good idea, because you cannot use the teaching language to build anything useful along the way; you learn something you have no use for later on; and the teaching languages are often not subsets of a real programming language, which may lead to confusion thanks to a slightly off terminology.<br>

After all, I think <a href="#org86f94a6">Racket</a> ticks most boxes if you strive for a deeper understanding of programming, computing and the bigger picture. Language design and usability are awesome, the syntax crystal clear, it has a comprehensive documentation, and Racket can teach you all the mind expanding concepts. No wonder, it&rsquo;s actively used for computer science and programming language research. It&rsquo;s also a bit academic. Oh, I said the A-word xP.<br>
</p>

<p>
And there is <a href="#org697d44e">Lua</a>. Here, the same nice things are to say about syntax, language design and documentation. It may not teach you all those fancy concepts like Racket does, but Lua is minimalist, so you&rsquo;ll be able to fit the whole language in your head, which is quite impossible with the other languages. Lua is also very practical and you can use it nearly everywhere.<br>
</p>

<p>
And &#x2013; as much as I hate to say it &#x2013; but <a href="#orgbe9a3ec">JavaScript</a> is also an option, but for pragmatic reasons. After all, it all depends on your individual priorities. JavaScript is highly performant, it is everywhere, will be immediately useful and supports most programming paradigms, e. g. functional programming (you&rsquo;re not stuck with imperative and object oriented programming like in Phyton).<br>

<h3 id="org63b92f0">My personal choice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org63b92f0">
<p>
On my shortlist I had Racket, Lua, Haskell and Common Lisp. Ultimately, I started with <a href="#orgc84a8f2">Common Lisp</a>. So what&rsquo;s my motivation for that?<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve looked into many books, and it turned out that I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/308BHa0">favorite textbook on programming</a> and I want to work with that one first. It is a great introduction and has many exercises. Secondly, I favour convenience and exploration. The interactive Common Lisp development workflow is far more advanced than anything I&rsquo;ve seen so far.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lisp goes very well with Emacs. <i>You don&rsquo;t have to use Emacs, there are plugins for <a href="https://atom.io/packages/slima">Atom</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ailisp.commonlisp-vscode">VSCode</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vlime/vlime">Vim</a> and others.</i> Emacs is written in <i>Emacs Lisp</i>, another programming language within the Lisp family. Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp are similar enough to avoid confusion while switching back and forth beetween both. <a href="https://hyperpolyglot.org/lisp">Compare the syntax of the four most used Lisps</a>. Actually, I&rsquo;m writing more Emacs Lisp than Common Lisp at the moment. But that&rsquo;s a story for another time.<br>
