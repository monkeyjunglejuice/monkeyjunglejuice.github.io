<h2 id="orgd2ef562">The hard Part</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd2ef562">
<p>
&ldquo;Learning a programming language&rdquo; applies foremost to programmers who already know how to program. For them, picking up a new language is possible within a couple of weeks (and for you too, once you&rsquo;ve gained some experience), and it does&rsquo;t matter really that much, which one &#x2013; because the patterns how to accomplish most things are roughly overlapping.<br>
</p>

<p>
But if you start out, you don&rsquo;t need to just learn a programming language; as a beginner:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You will have to learn <b>the language itself</b> with it&rsquo;s features, syntax, semantics and … warts. I would say this is the easiest thing of the three.<br></li>

<li>Then you want to learn <b>how to program</b>. It means learning how to analyze the problems you want to tackle, finding solutions and express them in algorithms and data structures, which is often not intuitive. For that, you&rsquo;re utilizing the various ways your programming langugage provides.<br></li>

<li>And there&rsquo;s <b>the technology part</b>, e. g. things like protocols, networking, cryptography, the platform or operating system, tooling and the language ecosystem. This is a vast ocean of knowledge, which requires some specialization.<br></li>
</ol>

Is it your plan to become a software developer? Software is built in different areas &#x2013; the most obvious within the web, is obviously the development of itself. But there are other areas than web frontend and web backend; like fintech, aircraft systems, robotics, telecom, water supply or internet of things. If you know exactly what your intentions are, you could start with a language of your specific field and go form there … or better not?<br>

<p>
The industry workhorse is probably not the right fit, because it could be either highly specific and/or comes with a lot of distracting things that don&rsquo;t matter for you right now. There&rsquo;s a reason one does not take the very first driving lessons on a bucket wheel excavator, but on a &#x2026; yes, a car. Or motorbike. If you pick the wrong one, you might not follow through.<br>
</p>

<p>
Life changes and programming is hard. So you should go with a language that&rsquo;s interesting to you &#x2013; for whatever reason &#x2013; and which is particularly suitable for learning, according to the criteria I lay out below. Read on, I will describe the most interesting languages further down.<br>
</p>

<p>
You may want to learn programming, even if you have no plans to become a part of the software producing workforce, like me. I&rsquo;ve worked quite a long time as a designer and in the online marketing industry, but have barely written any code at all, since there were always developers working alongside me and tasked with the wizardry.<br>
</p>

<p>
But I have always been interested in computer stuff, so I&rsquo;ve dabbled a lot with Linux, server administration and tweaking my configs as a means of procrastination. Real programming was the magical border I haven&rsquo;t crossed &#x2013; until recently.<br>
</p>

<p>
For my part, I want a tool in which I can think, and I&rsquo;d like to be able to prototype an idea if I have one. Further, I think programming can help us tremendously to develop our minds. I must say that hated mathematics in school and have been really bad at it, but I&rsquo;m fascinated and eventually I want to know what is this all about.<br>

<h3 id="org326955d">Available Learning Material</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org326955d">
<p>
For which programming language is the right learning material available? That point is huge!<br>
</p>

<p>
Most programming books or courses are not made for absolute beginners, but for programmers who want to <i>learn yet another language</i>. Remember, you want to <i>learn programming</i>, not just a language.<br>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Regular&rdquo; programming books are not &ldquo;too advanced&rdquo; to grasp; it&rsquo;s just that they <b>teach you the wrong things</b> instead of what you actually need to learn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beware, there&rsquo;s a lot of crap out there. And the more popular a programming language, the more crap you&rsquo;ll run into. First, learn how to learn things by yourself (in a way that fits your personality). That skill is likely the most valuable one you&rsquo;ll ever develop.<br>
</p>

<p>
I recommend a textbook or e-textbook <b>with exercises</b> as your main forge of knowledge, because books are still the most accessible media &#x2013; you can read a chapter even if you&rsquo;re queueing up somewhere, re-read each chapter until you got it, and <i>do the exercises</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Generally, I suggest to use material from university profs and/or other reputable personalities to make sure you adopt a well rounded foundation and good style, instead of jumping between random tutorials and bootcamps.<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve linked the best books below. Most of them come for free! Prepare to dabble with your textbook for quite some time. <i>So you really want an enjoyable one!</i> The most recommended book may not neccesarily be the right one for you; individual taste matters a lot.<br>

It seems there are two different groups of programmers. Those that see programming languages primarily as a means of production (category 1) and those who see it as instrument of human reason (categories 2 and 3):<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Pragmatic languages:</b> conservative, efficient, worse-is-better, boring.<br>
<i>&ldquo;A programming language is a tool to get the job done&rdquo;</i><br></li>
<li><b>Hackish languages:</b> multi-paradigm, anything goes, flexibility, unopinionated.<br>
<i>&ldquo;I pursue absolute freedom and like to explore the problem domain interactively&rdquo;</i><br></li>
<li><b>Constraining languages:</b> single-paradigm, protecting you from yourself, the-right-thing, opinionated.<br>
<i>&ldquo;I prefer one correct way according a fixed set of rules&rdquo;</i><br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Programming languages are created by different minds, within different eras, significantly influenced by fashion. One language may be a natural fit for a certain personality type, and a less fortunate choice for another. That even applies to programming itself &#x2013; it&rsquo;s easier for some and harder for others (doesn&rsquo;t mean those are more stupid &#x2013; ok, some really are).<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org71c8371" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org71c8371">Readability and Syntax</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71c8371">
<p>
As a novice coder, you&rsquo;ll need enough brain capacity left to maintain focus on the concepts and what (your) code does, without the language getting in your way. So you want a simple syntax that&rsquo;s easy to pick up and remember. You don&rsquo;t want surprises and gotchas.<br>
</p>

<p>
Code is also more often read than written. A clean syntax enables the reader to understand what&rsquo;s going on in the program. Consistency enables you to derive further things from things you already have learned before and speeds up your learning process.<br>

<div id="outline-container-org070c777" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org070c777">Expressive Power and Abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org070c777">
<p>
Expressivity means how simple it is to say certain things. There are a couple of factors who determine how expressive a programming language can be:<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfd9e0b2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgfd9e0b2">Low-level or High-level?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfd9e0b2">
<p>
Low-level does not mean &ldquo;worse&rdquo; or &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; than high-level &#x2013; it just refers to the fact that computers are built in many layers on top of each other, and the levels close to the physical machine are called the &ldquo;low level&rdquo;. You could also call it &ldquo;foundation&rdquo;, if you prefer a less judgementally sounding term xP<br>
</p>

<p>
High-level languages tend to be more expressive than low-level languages, because with each layer up, the grade of <i>abstraction</i> increases and more powerful ways to express complex things come into play.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7aabb80" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7aabb80">How simple is it to build Abstractions?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7aabb80">
<p>
What is abstraction? It means hiding the foundational workings of the level(s) below (eg. the physical machine) so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with them directly and can focus on your problem/idea instead.<br>
</p>

<p>
An analogy: A console used to control the lightshow of a concert is an abstraction over fumbling with the electricity cables and tieing them together to make light bulbs glow in a certain order. Now think about doing the light show only by messing with the wires. This is dangerous and way harder (nearly impossible) than using the console. And so it is with programming, too.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge6301ce" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge6301ce">Is it a wordy or concise Language?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge6301ce">
<p>
Do you have to write a lot of boilerplate or repeat yourself? In most cases you want an expressive high-level language; not overly verbose but also not too concise, so there&rsquo;s just the right amount of redundancy left to keep it comprehensible.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="orgb9f1a14">Usability and Programming Environment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb9f1a14">
<p>
Your language of choice ideally comes with tooling that&rsquo;s easy to use. Tooling means things like editor support (syntax highlighting, &ldquo;jump-to-definition&rdquo;, looking up documentation), helpful (or at least comprehensible) error messages, and package management for libraries.<br>
</p>

<p>
Libraries are pieces of code written by other programmers that can be re-used, so a developer has less work and doesn&rsquo;t need to code everything from scratch. A good selection of libraries determines what you can do with a language. Having many libraries is desirable for industrial use, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter so much in the beginning. Many languages can also use libraries from other programming languages/ecosystems.<br>
</p>

<p>
Consider to pick a language that comes with a <i>REPL</i>, sometimes called <i>console</i> or <i>toplevel</i>. That&rsquo;s basically like the command line running in a terminal emulator, but instead of shell commands you can run single pieces of your code. Well, nowadays many languages come with a REPL. But some go even further than that and enable true <i>interactive development</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Can you get started without huge ceremonies and fumbling for days?<br>

<div id="outline-container-org3a1ccf4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3a1ccf4">Popularity and Commmunity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3a1ccf4">
<blockquote cite="http://www.paulgraham.com/iflisp.html">
<p>
&ldquo;Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it&rsquo;s especially so in programming languages. More libraries get written for popular languages, which makes them still more popular. Programs often have to work with existing programs, and this is easier if they&rsquo;re written in the same language, so languages spread from program to program like a virus. And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.&rdquo;<br>
<cite>—<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/iflisp.html">Paul Graham</a></cite><br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Popular means just that: popular. It does not imply &ldquo;technically superior&rdquo; or &ldquo;simple&rdquo;. Popular languages have some benefits though &#x2013; for instance bigger ecosystems, which leads to many things built around the language to make the life of (experienced) programmers easier. Obviously, popular languages have also bigger communities.<br>
</p>

<p>
You don&rsquo;t need a huge community; smaller communities have their benefits, too. But it should be a welcoming one. Can you spot growth mindset and excitement?<br>
</p>

<p>

<p>
… in late autumn 2026 so I can get filthy rich coding in it? Well, nobody knows and it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Why? <i>Because it&rsquo;s about learning to code</i> &#x2013; which is a timeless skill &#x2013; not about a particular language. These come and go.<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s like being able to ride a bicycle. Once you&rsquo;ve learned the underlying principle, you won&rsquo;t die instantly when you fall over, and it will not make much of a difference if you hop on Grandma&rsquo;s grinder or shred your neighbour&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s tricycle, and you won&rsquo;t care if the current trend says in 10 years everyone will ride mountain bikes with pink tyres.<br>

<p>
There&rsquo;s in fact a thing that&rsquo;s getting more and more important, and that is <del>concurrency</del> <a href="https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350">parallelism</a>. Most languages in use today have been developed years ago when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&rsquo;s Law</a> was still valid. Back then, everyone expected single processors getting faster and faster, so it was perfectly fine to have languages to make programs running on a single processor, and no one cared to build in parallelism features.<br>
</p>

<p>
But that is not any more. To keep up with the demands of modern applications, we have no other chance than to put more processors into a computer, or to run the application distributed on multiple computers. To leverage the power of multi-core processors, we need to be able to program our software conveniently in a way to utilize all available cores.<br>
</p>

<p>
It may be a good idea to learn a programming language which is designed to build programs that run tasks in parallel.<br>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orged79e67">
<p>
While it may be tempting to begin with the new hyped language everyone is raving about, a mature programming language has the benefit of an organically grown user base, flaws ironed out, stuff being written about it, better tooling, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>
A mature language doesn&rsquo;t change every couple of months, so you can be sure to learn the &ldquo;right&rdquo; things &#x2013; you don&rsquo;t have to worry if you&rsquo;re learning old stuff without knowing.<br>

Some of them are actually better teaching languages, while others not so good and now I&rsquo;ll explain why. But be aware: that all of them suck. Yes.

<div id="outline-container-org01ea088" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org01ea088">ANSI C</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org01ea088">
<p>
Welcome to the low-level. Programs written in C tend to be much more performant than programs written in other languages. In other words, it is the fastest (practical) programming language. Performance-critical algorithms and other parts of applications are usually written in C; e. g. the Linux kernel, drivers, high-performance libraries, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>
There seems to be a tradeoff with programming languages:<br>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>either high run-time performance (fast) plus low programmer productivity → longer development time<br></li>
<li>or lower run-time performance (slow) but higher programmer productivity → shorter development time<br></li>
</ul>

<p>
Development time (human) is more expensive than run-time time (computer), so mostly we agree on a slower programming language to minimize the human effort. However, since performance is a matter of the implementation and not the programming language per se, it is &#x2026; a myth. There are really fast high level programming languages coming close to C performance; <a href="#orgebed74f">OCaml</a> for instance.<br>
</p>

<p>
You may hear here and there that one must learn programming in C before even thinking about anything else &#x2013; well, no. It is true that C code is in the underpinnings of almost every system nowadays, yes &#x2013; because most programming languages are not written in themselves, but in C. But there is no need to learn C as your first language: Start only with C if your main interest lies in electronics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming">systems programming</a>, or you have some other reason to work very close to the machine.<br>
</p>

<p>
If that is the case, and you wanna become that crazy hardware hacker, you may look into the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction">Arduino electronics platform</a>, coming with the Arduino programming language (which is basically a subset of C). Don&rsquo;t confuse C with C++ (an extension to C, but huge and messy) or C# (a Microsoft thing). <i>Look for &ldquo;ANSI C&rdquo;</i>, the standard.<br>

<h3 id="orgd2169cb">Lua</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd2169cb">
<p>
On the surface, Lua is quite similar to JavaScript &#x2013; just without the ugly parts (more about that later). Lua is elegant, performant, carefully designed and consistent. Therefore it is super easy to learn for <del>Muggles</del> Non-programmers, and probably the &ldquo;easiest&rdquo; programming language listed here.<br>
</p>

<p>
Why is Lua an &ldquo;easy language&rdquo;? First, it is compact: There are not a lot of concepts or features to learn before you can do something meaningful. But then you can go on and combine the small set of building blocks with each other in many ways to implement more sophisticated things. Lua is probably the most simliar language to the Scheme programming language.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lua is used in many domains, especially in the game industry (e. g. World of Warcraft, Roblox). Lua can be a high-level counterpart to C and can be embedded into C program code, so that high-level program logic &#x2013; like character behavior &#x2013; can be scripted in Lua, while the other parts of the software in need for raw metal speed can be written in C or C++.<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s straightforward to get started and build something with Lua: You might want to make your own 2D game with the Löve game engine, or you could use it to code native games and other apps for Android. There&rsquo;s a really nice IDE (&ldquo;Integrated Development Environment&rdquo;) for Lua programming, called &ldquo;ZeroBrane Studio&rdquo;; think of it as an extended editor especially for Lua.<br>
</p>

<p>
As far as I know, there are not many textbooks available, but you can use <i>the</i> book written by Lua&rsquo;s chief architect Roberto Ierusalimschy. And there&rsquo;s a wiki and many many user tutorials. Lua is primarily developed at the University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). Once you&rsquo;ve committed to learn Lua, I recommend to buy the 4th edition to support the project.<br>

<h3 id="orgfd210c6">Clojure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfd210c6">
<p>
As a total noob, I&rsquo;ve been looking for a language with a simple syntax, because who wants to run into syntax errors all the time? Clojure is a member of the <i>Lisp</i> family; those have the cleanest syntax of all programming languages. Further, it seems to be the most expressive general purpose language, and it&rsquo;s designed especially with concurrency in mind.<br>
</p>

<p>
The language is built on top of the Java platform. Software built on Java can run on almost any major operating system. Clojure can be used for different things, even for artsy stuff. Just as an example: <a href="https://overtone.github.io/">you can do live coding and make algorithmic music</a>, and there are things like algo-raves (yup, that exists …).<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also a practical language to build serious business software with, because it can use Java&rsquo;s enormous library ecosystem. And there&rsquo;s <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>, a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript (so you won&rsquo;t have to write web apps in JavaScript).<br>
</p>

<p>
The language is a refreshing start on Lisp and very well designed. But there&rsquo;s also that Java underbelly who sticks out here and there, coming with it&rsquo;s own terminology. And that&rsquo;s the drawback &#x2013; you&rsquo;ll have to wade into the Java stuff later and swallow the bleak Java speak for a deeper understanding of Clojure.<br>
</p>

<p>
If you want to try it, I recommend the book &ldquo;Clojure for the Brave and True&rdquo;; it had given me enlightening moments how functions take functions and spit out functions, like interlocking parts of a imaginary robot factory that builds little machine building machines, who build machines and transform … But I think that could also be a general property of functional-first languages (or Lisp?) in general. However, the book convinced me also to take a look at Emacs and I don&rsquo;t regret that.<br>

<h3 id="orgdabaf4a">Scheme and Racket</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdabaf4a">
<p>
Pleasantly surprised by Clojure, I&rsquo;ve looked up other languages from the Lisp family. Scheme is commonly recommended to beginners, especially for those who are interested in computer science.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like other Lisps, Scheme shares the same uniform list representation of source code (actually these are tree structures), which makes it easier to paint a mental picture of the program structure. There&rsquo;s no clutter, which I like.<br>
</p>

<p>
Scheme is opinionated in so far to stay unopinionated &#x2013; meaning, it&rsquo;s a clean slate and people are eager to keep it that way. It is a minimalist language and often considered as the most elegant and consistent programming language in existence.<br>
</p>

<p>
That makes it excellent for learning, reasoning about computation and to design algorithms, but not so much for quickly building some commercial business app stuff.<br>
</p>

<p>
Racket is a descendant of Scheme (it was called PLT Scheme before). But Racket is far from minimal. It has tons of features built in and you can think of Racket as &ldquo;Scheme with batteries included&rdquo;, and it is also platform for programming language research.<br>
</p>

<p>
Scheme can run on Racket, so even if you just want to learn the Scheme language, you can do it comfortably in Racket. That may sound a bit confusing, but it actually isn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll see.<br>
</p>

<p>
Further, Racket emphasizes &ldquo;language oriented programming&rdquo;. It means you can design your own small (domain specific) programming languages for your particular application and then write your application in that language. But you don&rsquo;t have to &#x2013; you can just use &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Racket like everyone else. So don&rsquo;t bother with that for now.<br>
</p>

<p>
The most recommended book on (functional) programming is the classic &ldquo;Structure and Interpretation of Programming Languages&rdquo;, abbreviatet &ldquo;SICP&rdquo;. It was written as an introduction for computer science students at MIT, using Scheme. But for me it was a bit too much as a very first book. But check it out anyway, it&rsquo;s really philosophical.<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve also began to read &ldquo;How to Design Programs&rdquo;, which is supposedly easier and often recommended to read before SICP, but found it earnest and dry. The other books are quite different. Personally I recommend &ldquo;Simply Scheme&rdquo;, &ldquo;Realm of Racket&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Little Schemer&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
You can get started very easily with Scheme and Racket &#x2013; one single install and go, no matter if you are on Windows, Linux or Mac. You don&rsquo;t even have to be familiar with the command line, because it comes with DrRacket, a friendly and easy to use programming environment (IDE).<br>

<h3 id="org53afc68">Common Lisp</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org53afc68">
<p>
The initial reason for me to use a programming language wasn&rsquo;t coding. Actually I wanted just a better calculator. A REPL makes a way better calculator than the silly concept of an interface resembling a physical pocket calculator with big buttons and a single line display.<br>
</p>

<p>
Well, here Lisp&rsquo;s functional notation felt really weird for doing arithmetik: Instead of <code>10 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7</code> you write <code>(+ 10 3 4 6 7)</code>. There are no operators, everything it&rsquo;s basically function application. It makes a couple of things easier, for instance writing programs who write programs who write &#x2026; well, that&rsquo;s for later. The syntax is easy to remember so it doesn&rsquo;t get in your way, and you can concentrate on the things that really matter.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think the most compelling books and essays have been written on Lisp, and it has the best learning material I could find. Well, Lisp has been around for a while.<br>
</p>

<p>
What really fascinates me, is that Lisp is no obscure box, where you write some keywords and then something underneath does some things and you don&rsquo;t know what and why. Lisp is different: everything is built from a few simple pieces. That makes it quite straightforward to paint a mental picture how it actually works.<br>
</p>

<p>
The tooling is excellent and designed for interactive development. <b>There&rsquo;s a really nice <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cl-repl/id1511296102">App for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eql5.android.repl">Android</a> called &ldquo;CL REPL&rdquo;.</b> You can use it to tinker around when ever you feel like <i>&ldquo;Damn, I wish I could write some Lisp right now!&rdquo;</i> You can. It&rsquo;s in fact a complete Common Lisp IDE with SLIME, the &ldquo;Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
But usually you want it on your laptop. There are plugins for <a href="https://atom.io/packages/slima">Atom</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ailisp.commonlisp-vscode">VSCode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vlime/vlime">Vim</a>, although I recommend Emacs, which is straightforward to install <a href="https://portacle.github.io/">via Portacle</a>, a ready-made bundle coming with everything you need. If you don&rsquo;t know Emacs yet, do:<br>
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Menu → &ldquo;Options&rdquo; → &ldquo;Use CUA keys&rdquo;<br></li>
<li>Menu → &ldquo;Options&rdquo; → &ldquo;Save options&rdquo;<br></li>
</ol>
<p>
&#x2013; then copy &amp; paste works like everywhere else.<br>

<div id="outline-container-orgbca058a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbca058a">Erlang and Elixir</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbca058a">
<p>
The Erlang platform is an integral building block of today&rsquo;s telecommunication networks. Your mobile provider&rsquo;s infrastructure runs likely on Erlang, and so does WhatsApp. Erlang is not just a programming language, but a complex framework to write forever-running network applications; you can even think of it as an operating system. The whole point behind Erlang is to build fault-tolerant systems &#x2013; it&rsquo;s all about error handling and staying online. <a href="https://adoptingerlang.org/docs/development/otp_high_level/">For more details on what the Erlang platform is, check this out</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>
To achive fault tolerance, Erlang leverages concurrency through an interesting concept, the <a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">actor model</a>. That makes Erlang platform a natural fit for mission-critical infrastructure, decentralized computing, peer-to-peer networking, messaging apps and servers with hundreds of thousands of simultaneous active users, internet of things … Ok ok, I see you got it.<br>
</p>

<p>
Besides Erlang the platform there&rsquo;s Erlang the language, and there&rsquo;s Elixir. Those are two languages to write applications for the Erlang platform. Erlang (ERicsson LANGuage) is the original language, which is pragmatic, compact and quite simple.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elixir on the other hand is a new, alternative syntax to make it look like Ruby for marketing purposes and faciliate acceptance by Ruby developers (that&rsquo;s another programming language; was quite popular for some time but now falling out of favor) plus some additional features like macros (Lisp-style metaprogramming).<br>
</p>

<p>
What I dislike about Elixir is that many constructs have 3-4 &ldquo;shorthands&rdquo; to write the same thing. It looks a bit like the language designers couldn&rsquo;t decide what to keep and what to throw out. Some of those constructs work only under specific circumstances, where others don&rsquo;t &#x2013; more consistency would be better. All in all, the syntax looks a bit verbose and clumsy to me, and I like the original Erlang syntax better.<br>
</p>

<p>
Does it make sense to learn programming with Elixir? Most books only go through the language itself and it&rsquo;s features. There is not really learning material available for absolute beginners. The first one I listed below is quite short and covers some basics, but there&rsquo;s a gap between that and the second one, which requires some prior knowledge (but not much).<br>
</p>

<p>
Like with other hosted languages (Clojure on Java, Elm on JavaScript, …), the additional stuff coming with the Erlang platform may be a bit distracting. So if you want to learn Erlang or Elixir, you should have a particular reason to work on the Erlang platform.<br>
</p>

<p>
Erlang or Elixir or both? You&rsquo;ll come pretty far with Elixir alone before you really need to dive into the platform technology. It doesn&rsquo;t impose on you compared to Java. And once you are there, you&rsquo;ll have to develop an understanding of Erlang the language too, because the Erlang platform is explained in terms of Erlang the language, not in terms of Elixir.<br>

<h3 id="orgc7d3765">JavaScript</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc7d3765">
<p>
With JavaScript, you can build all kind of things in the browser and show it to your internet friends, without having them to download or install anything. JavaScript is the only language browsers support directly, still &#x2013; and that&rsquo;s why everybody and their dog&rsquo;s fleas are coding JavaScript.<br>
</p>

<p>
JavaScript <del>is</del> was an imperative language at the very heart, but you can write object-oriented and functional style too. JavaScript assimilates new features with each version and therefore it&rsquo;s getting bigger and bigger. Resistance is futile. Or is it?<br>
</p>

<p>
The language has good tooling and is easy to start with, and you may have heard &ldquo;all you need is a web browser and a text editor&rdquo;. Well, um, nope. That&rsquo;s not really the truth. Expect a lot exceptions, special cases and to work around the poor language design.<br>
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;ll need to learn to avoid the pitfalls, and using a <a href="https://eslint.org/">linter</a> (that&rsquo;s a tool that checks your code and tells you where the problematic or deprecated parts are) is mandatory to prevent you from using probably harmful things and deprecated stuff.<br>
</p>

<p>
Overall, it&rsquo;s a verbose frankenstein language that&rsquo;s a pain to read. Of course there are the usual suspects who disagree and even &ldquo;love&rdquo; JavaScript. These people either don&rsquo;t know any better, or suffer from a variant of the Stockholm Syndrome. Honestly, all of that doesn&rsquo;t make it a good choice for a first time programmer, but many start to learn programming with JavaScript, unfortunally.<br>
</p>

<p>
If you just wanna build web apps or browser games, you do have other choices (check out Elm down below) but eventually you need to know JavaScript, but maybe not necessarily learn it as your very first language.<br>

<div id="outline-container-orgbacc972" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbacc972">Elm</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbacc972">
<p>
Elm is a descendant of OCaml and Haskell that compiles to JavaScript: You write your website&rsquo;s code in Elm, and then the Elm compiler writes the JavaScript for you, so that your web browser can run it. If that sounds like it makes no sense, think about it this way: All programming languages compile down to another language on a lower level anyway, and those again and again, until your code&rsquo;s representation is only 11010101. Elm is just another layer on top.<br>
</p>

<p>
Why not writing JavaScript directly? Elm comes with a few interesting features: first and foremost a <i>static type system</i> (like OCaml), which helps you to feel (more) sure about the correctness of your code (think: less undiscovered bugs). And you don&rsquo;t have to deal with JavaScripts screwed type conversion. Secondly, Elm is a pure functional programming language: That makes it&rsquo;s easier to reason about what code actually does. And it comes with <i>immutable values</i>: ever writhed in disgust when you saw <code>x = x + 1</code>? Then Elm is for you.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Elm syntax is simple and the Elm compiler famous for its helpful error messages &#x2013; like a built-in teacher who pushes you gently into the right direction on your path to statically typed functional programming. And you will learn one way how to structure your application: &ldquo;The Elm Architecture&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s why I consider Elm a good fit for learning, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s still a very young and domain-specifig language that runs exclusively in the browser. Which in turn means you&rsquo;ll need to know HTML and CSS, at least at a basic level. There is not much literature out there about Elm, but it opens the door to other statically typed functional languages, like OCaml or Haskell.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elm comes with an easy installation and convenient tooling. The language is nicely designed as a whole piece, and it&rsquo;s quite opinionated: You&rsquo;ll need to do most things like intended by its <del>creator</del> dictator, similar to Python. But that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why everything within the Elm ecosystem fits so well together.<br>
</p>

<p>
If I like Elm but it&rsquo;s a browser-only language, why not learn &ldquo;the real thing&rdquo; &#x2013; Haskell or OCaml?<br>

<h3 id="orgfd65d7d">Haskell</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfd65d7d">
<p>
Contrary to popular belief, basic Haskell is easy to learn; that&rsquo;s even more true for a person who hasn&rsquo;t programmed before. It may be less straightforward for experienced developers, since they have preconceptions about programming.<br>
</p>

<p>
Haskell has got a <a href="https://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-syntax/">clean syntax</a>, but many programmers have learned a verbose, imperative language first and probably nothing else since then. So they are alienated and they whish everything else looked like their curly-braces soup of C+-#$, Java, JavaScript or whatever.<br>
</p>

<p>
Haskell is by no means a compact language. Haskellers &#x2026; Haskelleers? Hasklers? Haskys??? Those who do the Haskell, you know &#x2013; yes. They tend to be clever, so they like to use the advanced features the language and its numerous extensions have to offer. It will get complicated very soon when you&rsquo;ll want to read code others have fabricated.<br>
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s no clear path to get started with Haskell. Downloading the compiler and starting <i>ghci</i> (the REPL) to evaluate some expressions is no big deal of course, and to compiling some code neither. But if you go a bit further and want some more convenience and install libraries, there are a couple of different approaches which tooling set to use, and they overlap in functionality, and &#x2026; That&rsquo;s really confusing.<br>
</p>

<p>
Not all hope is lost: If you are just interested in functional programming, you&rsquo;re better off to start with OCaml (see below) or even Elm; both are better languages to learn. You can still move on to Haskell later, if you feel like (Nah don&rsquo;t. Use OCaml instead). If you wanna give it a shot nevertheless, download <i>Stack</i> and then install everything else via Stack. But better OCaml.<br>

<p>
OCaml shines where speed and correct code are highly sought after; like financial technology, blockchain, compilers &#x2026; <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html">Some big companies</a> are heavily invested in OCaml. Many universities use OCaml to teach computer science, and I found quiete a lot beginner-friendly learning material.<br>
</p>

<p>
OCaml is in the same family as Elm and Haskell, but has less ideological ballast and is more practical, although still not as popular. OCaml seems to be due for a rise in popularity and it got a lot of support within the last time. The tooling is already better than than Haskell&rsquo;s, and there are further improvements on the way.<br>
</p>

<p>
If I would have to describe OCaml in two adjectives, I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; and &ldquo;elegant&rdquo;. I had no WTF moments so far with the language. OCaml syntax looks clean and readable and is no curly braces massacre.<br>
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;ll have a seamless user experience on Linux and automatic setup for the most popular editors. OCaml works also well on Windows via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</a>. You may run into an issue during the installing process in WSL because of WSL&rsquo;s limitations; anyway, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/12050#issuecomment-393478072">there&rsquo;s a workaround</a> for that.<br>
</p>

<p>
Further, learning OCaml is a perfectly reasonable introduction to F# (F Sharp), which is essentially a modified OCaml clone by Microsoft that runs on the .NET platform.<br>

<h3 id="org8bd8831">Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8bd8831">
<p>
It is one of the most popular languages right now, behind JavaScript and C. Popularity is probably Python&rsquo;s biggest benefit. So if there&rsquo;s something programmable, like say, some cheap consumer drone, then it&rsquo;s likely programmable in Python.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are Python libraries for almost everything. Many of those libraries are actually written in other languages (e.g. C or C++) for performance reasons, because Python itself is the slowest of the languages listed here. It just happens that many libraries have a Python interface, that means they are made accessible from Python.<br>
</p>

<p>
The syntax looks clean and readable, almost like broken English. It&rsquo;s said to be an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; language, but I don&rsquo;t think so. I find others actually better understandable and less ambiguous. It&rsquo;s more like … well selected code examples look easy, and the onboarding process is made frictionless to shovel newcomers in.<br>
</p>

<p>
Python is highly opinionated: The creators encourage that certain things should (only) be done in their way &#x2013; what they call &rsquo;pythonic&rsquo;. The opposite is &rsquo;unpythonic&rsquo;. &ldquo;To describe something as &lsquo;clever&rsquo; is not considered a compliment in the Python culture&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think Python is a dead end and not future-proof, even if it&rsquo;s popular right now, because it locks you into a narrow path (&ldquo;the pythonic way&rdquo;), and paints you in the object-oriented corner with all the complexity that comes with it, while making other paradigms (like functional programming) cumbersome/impossible.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beginners should not put blinkers on and march &rsquo;the pythonic way&rsquo;, but start with a language that opens the mind. Is Python a good first language? I considered to learn Python a couple of years ago. After some research I found other languages far more elegant and interesting.<br>
</p>

<p>
If you want a powerful scripting language which is even easier to learn, compact and really fast, you may have fun with <a href="#orgd2169cb">Lua</a>. And if popularity is still such a thing for you after <a href="#org3a1ccf4">reading this</a>, you might be better off with <a href="#orgc7d3765">JavaScript</a>.<br>

<h3 id="org3794db3">Julia</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3794db3">
<p>
Julia is developed as a practical high performance vehicle for technical and scientific computing, as an alternative to Python, Fortran, R and other languages used in the field. I would say its not a language to build ready-to-ship software, but more like a framework for scientific computing tasks.<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s still a young language, but pushed by a couple of organizations. So there&rsquo;s more of an ecosystem than you would expect for a language in that early state. But it&rsquo;s targeted on scientists who already know how to program, so don&rsquo;t expect introduction material for total beginners.<br>
</p>

<p>
Julia looks very friendly and easy to start with, and you should definitely check it out if you&rsquo;re a student and work in &ldquo;data science&rdquo;, statistics, numerical computing or want to plot some stuff (<a href="#orgdabaf4a">Racket</a> shines here, too).<br>

<b>Choose well, but don&rsquo;t obsess too much about it:</b> I&rsquo;ve already done that part for you! You are going to learn a couple more programming languages after your first one, so it is not a lifetime decision, even if you feel like that now.<br>

<h3 id="orgccbdea7">The 3 best Programming Languages to learn Programming</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgccbdea7">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="#orgdabaf4a"><b>Racket</b></a> offers hand-holding of it&rsquo;s finest. It has the lowest entry barrier if you have not yet touched any code yet, but also the craziest and &ldquo;most powerful&rdquo;. It can teach you all the mind exploding concepts, comes with educational books and exceptional documentation. It&rsquo;s also quite academic and not used in industrial settings. Oh, I said the A-word :P But you can build shiny things with it, that is what counts.<br></li>

<li><a href="#orgd2169cb"><b>Lua</b></a> may not teach you all those fancy concepts like Racket and OCaml right upfront. But being minimalist (but very powerful), you will be able to fit the entire language in your head at some point, which is quite impossible with most other languages. Lua is also super practical: it runs everywhere and you can use it for various things.<br></li>

<li><a href="#orgebed74f"><b>OCaml</b></a> emphasizes functional programming but supports multiple paradigms, so it can give you a well-rounded education. It is a modern functional language used in academics and in the industry to build mission-critical software. Not sooo much hand-holding here, but a language without WTFs where just everything seems to make sense.<br></li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5adc086">
<p>
When I was looking around for learning material, I found this one to be <a href="https://amzn.to/308BHa0">my favorite programming book</a>. I&rsquo;ve had a hard time choosing, and honestly I&rsquo;m still torn between <a href="#org53afc68">Common Lisp</a>, <a href="#orgfd210c6">Clojure</a> and <a href="#orgebed74f">OCaml</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Eventually I started with Common Lisp, <a href="learning-to-code-first-app-episode-1.tutorial.html">let&rsquo;s see how it goes</a>. I think the Lisp workflow fits pretty well to my preference for building things exploratively bottom-up. The interactivity offers something completely different from the write-compile-wait-run-repeat cycle of most languages.<br>
</p>

<p>
Besides that, for an Emacs user it makes sense to learn Lisp, because Emacs itself is written in Lisp too, and so I always have something to tinker with. Although <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html">Emacs Lisp</a> is different from Common Lisp, both languages are close enough to not get confused (<a href="https://hyperpolyglot.org/lisp">compare sample code here</a>).<br>
</p>

<p>
So which programming language are you going to learn now?<br>
