<h2 id="org511c101">The easy part</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org511c101">
<p>
&ldquo;Learning a programming language&rdquo; is what applies foremost to programmers who already know how to program. For them, picking up a new language is possible within a couple of weeks (and for you too, once you&rsquo;ve gained some experience), and it does&rsquo;t matter really that much which one &#x2013; because the patterns how to accomplish most things are roughly overlapping.<br>
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org156a11b">The hard part</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org156a11b">
<p>
But if you start out, you don&rsquo;t need to just learn a programming language. <b>First, you want to learn how to program</b>. It means learning how to analyze a problem you want to tackle, finding a solution and express it in code, which is often not intuitive. Plus, you still have to learn a programming language with syntax and semantics, too. So that is two things at once.<br>

<h3 id="org7e1f9e6">Your reason for learing to code</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7e1f9e6">
<p>
You might be someone who wants to prepair for a career as a software developer. There are different areas where software is developed &#x2013; the loudest within the web, is obviously the development of itself. But there are other areas like fintech, aircraft systems, robotics, telecom, water supply or internet of things. If you know exactly what you intent to do, you could start with a language of your specific field and go form there. Or maybe better not?<br>
</p>

<p>
You could also learn a language that&rsquo;s interesting for you and is particularly suitable for learning, according to those criteria I lay out below. I&rsquo;m also going to describe the most interesting languages and their idiosyncrasies.<br>
</p>

<p>
You may want to learn programming, even if you don&rsquo;t have plans to become a professional software developer, like me. I&rsquo;ve worked quite a long time as a designer and in online marketing industry, but have barely written any code at all, since there were always developers working alongside me and tasked with the wizardry.<br>
</p>

<p>
But I have always been interested in computer stuff, so I&rsquo;ve dabbled a lot with Linux, server administration and tweaking my configs as a means of procrastination. Real programming was the magical border I haven&rsquo;t crossed &#x2013; until recently.<br>
</p>

<p>
For my part, I want a tool in which I can think, and I&rsquo;d like to be able to prototype an idea if I have one. Further, I think programming can help us tremendously to develop our minds. I must say that hated mathematics in school and have been really bad at it, but eventually I want to know what is this all about. So I have to start somewhere.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="org0d31867">What kind of animal are you?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0d31867">
<p>
People weigh values differently and use their cognitive functions in different orders. You may be aware that not everyone thinks in the way you do. Or you may even know you are <del>weird</del> different. Well, it is likely so, and if that weren&rsquo;t a common phenomenon, mankind would probably not have survived to this day.<br>
</p>

<p>
Programming languages are created by different minds, within different eras, significantly influenced by fashion. One language may be a natural fit for a certain personality type, and a less fortunate choice for another. That even applies to programming itself &#x2013; it&rsquo;s easier for some and harder for others (doesn&rsquo;t mean those are more stupid).<br>
</p>

<p>
For our purpose, programming languages can be assigned to the following categories:<br>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Pragmatic languages:</b> conservative, efficient, boring.<br>
<i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me think too much, let&rsquo;s get this job done&rdquo;</i><br>
(C, Java, Go)<br></li>
<li><b>Hackish languages:</b> multi-paradigm, anything goes, unopinionated.<br>
<i>&ldquo;I pursue absolute freedom and like to explore the problem domain interactively&rdquo;</i><br>
(Perl, JavaScript, Lisp, Smalltalk)<br></li>
<li><b>Constraining languages:</b> single-paradigm, protecting you from yourself, opinionated.<br>
<i>&ldquo;I prefer one correct way according a fixed set of rules&rdquo;</i><br>
(Scheme, Python, Haskell, Elm)<br></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5aba38c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5aba38c">Learning Material</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5aba38c">
<p>
For which programming language is the best learning material available? This point is huge. I&rsquo;d go so far and choose a first language solely on this single criterion.<br>
</p>

<p>
Most programming books or courses are not made for absolute beginners, but for programmers who want to learn another language. Remember, <i>you want to learn programming</i>, not just a language (You&rsquo;re going to learn the language on the go, and it will not be your only one).<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s not that &ldquo;regular&rdquo; programming books are &ldquo;too advanced&rdquo; to grasp; it&rsquo;s just that they teach the wrong things, instead of the things you&rsquo;ll actually need to learn.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think it would be wise to prefer material from university profs and/or other reputable personalities to make sure you adopt a well rounded foundation and good style, instead of jumping between random tutorials. The more popular the language, the more crap you&rsquo;ll run into.<br>
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s why I recommend a textbook or e-textbook <b>with exercises</b> as your main forge of knowledge, because books are still the most accessible media &#x2013; you can read a chapter even if you&rsquo;re queueing up somewhere.<br>
</p>

<p>
Prepare to dabble with your textbook for quite some time. <i>So you really want an enjoyable one!</i> The most recommended book may not neccesarily be the right one for you; individual taste matters a lot. I&rsquo;ve listed the best available programming books below with some alternatives, for each language.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org350df9a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org350df9a">The Future</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org350df9a">
<p>
Which programming language will be in high demand in late Autumn 2026 so I can get filthy rich coding in it? Well, nobody knows and it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Why? <i>Because it&rsquo;s about learning to code</i> &#x2013; which is a timeless skill &#x2013; not about a particular language (those come and go).<br>
</p>

<p>
Programming is a skill like being able to ride a bicycle without dying instantly when you fall over. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the underlying principle, it will not make much of a difference if you hop on Grandma&rsquo;s grinder or shred your neighbour&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s tricycle, and it will not matter much if the current trend says in 10 years everyone is riding nothing but mountain bikes with pink tyres.<br>
</p>

<p>
But! There&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s getting more and more important. It&rsquo;s called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)">concurrency</a></i>. Most languages in use today have been developed years ago when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&rsquo;s Law</a> was still valid. Back then, everyone expected single processors getting faster and faster, so it was perfectly fine to have languages to make programs running on a single processor, and no one cared to build in concurrency features.<br>
</p>

<p>
But that is not any more. To keep up with the demands of modern applications, we have no other chance than to put more processors into a computer, or to run the application distributed on multiple computers. To leverage the power of multi-core processors, we need to be able to program our software conveniently in a way to utilize all available cores.<br>
</p>

<p>
It leads to two things:<br>
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Using a programming language that is designed with concurrency in mind and simplifies building concurrent software<br></li>
<li>Learning how to program concurrent software<br></li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org98799c5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org98799c5">Community and Popularity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org98799c5">
<p>
Popular languages have some benefits &#x2013; for instance bigger ecosystems, which leads to many things built around the language to make the life of (experienced) programmers easier.<br>
</p>

<p>
Libraries are part of the ecosystem: those are pieces of code written by other programmers that can be re-used, so a developer has less work and doesn&rsquo;t need to code everything from scratch.<br>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, popular languages have also bigger communities. You don&rsquo;t need a huge community, but it should be a welcoming one. Smaller communities have their benefits, too.<br>
</p>

<p>
700,000 people fullmoon rave or beach party with friends? Meh, forget both and practice some social distancing &#x2013; it&rsquo;s quite popular right now!<br>

<div id="outline-container-org7bd3e58" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7bd3e58">Expressive Power and Abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7bd3e58">
<p>
Expressivity means how simple it is to say certain things. There are a couple of factors who determine how expressive a programming language can be:<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2150bae" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2150bae">Low-level or High-level?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2150bae">
<p>
Low-level does not mean &ldquo;worse&rdquo; or &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; than high-level &#x2013; it just refers to the fact that computers are built in many layers on top of each other, and the levels close to the physical machine are called the &ldquo;low level&rdquo;. You could also call it &ldquo;foundation&rdquo;, if you prefer a less judgementally sounding term xP<br>
</p>

<p>
High-level languages tend to be more expressive than low-level languages, because with each layer up, the grade of <i>abstraction</i> increases and more powerful ways to express complex things come into play.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org33d8cf3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org33d8cf3">How simple is it to build Abstractions?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org33d8cf3">
<p>
What is abstraction? It means hinding the foundational workings of the level(s) below (eg. the physical machine) so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with them directly and can focus on your problem/idea instead.<br>
</p>

<p>
An analogy: A console used to control the lightshow of a concert is an abstraction over fumbling with the electricity cables and tieing them together to make light bulbs glow in a certain order. Now think about doing the light show only by messing with the wires. This is dangerous and way harder (nearly impossible) than using the console. And so it is with programming, too.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5e9b74f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5e9b74f">Is it a wordy or concise Language?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5e9b74f">
<p>
Do you have to write a lot of boilerplate or repeat yourself? In most cases you want an expressive high-level language; not overly verbose but also not too concise, so there&rsquo;s just the right amount of redundancy left to keep it comprehensible.<br>
</p>

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf97c2ba" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf97c2ba">Syntax and Consistency</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf97c2ba">
<p>
As a novice coder, you probably want to start out quickly, and you&rsquo;ll need enough brain capacity left to maintain focus on the important things, without the language getting in your way. So you want a simple syntax that&rsquo;s easy to pick up and remember.<br>
</p>

<p>
A thoroughly designed programming language suits well for learning, because you will encounter less surprises and pitfalls. Consistency helps you to derive further things from things you already have learned before.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org53f3b57" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org53f3b57">Maturity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org53f3b57">
<p>
While it may be tempting to start with the current hyped language everyone is raving about, a mature programming language has the benefit of an organically grown user base, flaws ironed out, stuff being written about it, better tooling, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>
A mature language doesn&rsquo;t change every couple of months, so you can be sure to learn the &ldquo;right&rdquo; things &#x2013; you don&rsquo;t have to worry if you&rsquo;re learning old stuff without knowing.<br>
</p>

<p>
Which language has been around for quite a while, but implements modern, interesting and useful concepts that may be relevant in the future?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6599724" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6599724">Tooling and Usability</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6599724">
<p>
Your language of choice should come with tooling that&rsquo;s easy to use. It includes things like editor support (syntax highlighting, &ldquo;jump-to-definition&rdquo;, looking up documentation), helpful (or at least comprehensible) error messages, and package management for libraries.<br>
</p>

<p>
A good selection of libraries is desirable for industrial use, but doesn&rsquo;t matter sooo much in the beginning. Some languages can even use libraries from other programming languages / ecosystems, and go even further than that.<br>
</p>

<p>
Consider to pick a language that comes with a <i>REPL</i>, sometimes called <i>console</i> or <i>toplevel</i>. That&rsquo;s basically like the command line running in a terminal emulator, but instead of shell commands you can run single pieces of your code. Well, nowadays many languages come with a REPL. But some go even further than that and enable true <i>interactive development</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Can you get started without fumbling for days?<br>

<h2 id="orgdde854a">Choose your Poison</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdde854a">
<p>
Here is a fine selection of programming languages, they can serve you well as your first language, and later too.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2f29887" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2f29887">ANSI C</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2f29887">
<p>
It is one of the 3 most popular languages for a long time, so I&rsquo;m listing it here just because it&rsquo;s relevant. I haven&rsquo;t considered learning it, nor would I recommend it, unless your goal is to program micro-controllers, drones, robots, embedded systems, hack on the Linux kernel or hardware drivers. Well then, welcome to the low-level.<br>
</p>

<p>
Programs written in C tend to be much more performant than programs written in other languages. In other words, it is the fastest (practical) programming language. Performance-critical algorithms and other parts of applications are usually written in C.<br>
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t confuse it with C++ (a huge mess) or C# (a Microsoft thing). <i>Look for &ldquo;ANSI C&rdquo;</i> &#x2013; it is the standard. The book I&rsquo;ve listed below is a classic of computer science literature.<br>
</p>

<p>
You may hear here and there that C is the foundation for everything and everyone must learn programming in C before even thinking about anything else &#x2013; nope, don&rsquo;t waste your time. Learn C if you have a genuine interest or reason to work very close to the machine.<br>

<h3 id="org0a703f2">Lua</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0a703f2">
<p>
On the surface, Lua is quite similar to JavaScript &#x2013; just without the ugly parts. Lua is minimalist but extendable, clear and comprehensible, well designed and consistent. Therefore it is super easy to learn for <del>Muggles</del> Non-programmers.<br>
</p>

<p>
The language is mainly used in the game industry (e. g. World of Warcraft, Roblox). Lua goes very well with C and it can be embedded into C code, so that high-level program logic &#x2013; like character behavior &#x2013; can be scripted in Lua, while the other parts of the software in need for raw metal speed can be written in C.<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s quite simple to get started and build something with Lua: You might want to make your own 2D game with the <a href="https://love2d.org/">Löve game engine</a>, you can use it to code native games and other apps for Android.<br>
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a really nice IDE (&ldquo;Integrated Development Environment&rdquo;) for Lua programming, called &ldquo;ZeroBrane Studio&rdquo;; think of it as an extended editor especially for Lua.<br>
</p>

<p>
As far as I know, there are not many textbooks available, but I&rsquo;ve linked the standard book written by the language inventor down below, and there&rsquo;s a wiki and many many user tutorials.<br>

<h3 id="orgbdfc1cc">Clojure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbdfc1cc">
<p>
As a total noob, I&rsquo;ve been looking for a language with a super simple syntax, because learning syntax scared me the most. Clojure is a member of the family with the simplest syntax of all programming languages: It is a Lisp, and it&rsquo;s a popular one, too. Further, it seems to be the most expressive general purpose language, and it&rsquo;s designed especially with concurrency in mind.<br>
</p>

<p>
The language is built on top of the Java platform. Software built on Java can run on almost any major operating system &#x2013; Windows, Linux, Mac, etc. Clojure can be used for different things, even for artsy stuff. Just as an example: <a href="https://overtone.github.io/">you can do live coding and make algorithmic music</a>, and there are things like algo-raves (yup, that exists &#x2026;).<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also a practical language to build serious business software with, because it can use Java&rsquo;s huge library ecosystem. And there&rsquo;s <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>, a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript (so you you won&rsquo;t have to write web apps in JavaScript). Clojure Developers reap the biggest salaries according to several studies. Not that it means something, just sayin&rsquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
I recommend the book &ldquo;Clojure for the Brave and True&rdquo;; it had given me a few enlightening moments: Suddenly I had lively visions of how all the parts interlock: functions built of functions, taking functions and spitting out functions, like moving parts of a giant machine. The book convinced me also to take a look at Emacs, which is a mindblowing beast of itself.<br>
</p>

<p>
Clojure&rsquo;s drawbacks are those not-so-helpful error messages. Plus, there&rsquo;s that Java underbelly who sticks out here and there, coming with it&rsquo;s own terminology.<br>

<h3 id="org5302913">Scheme and Racket</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5302913">
<p>
Pleasantly surprised by Clojure, I&rsquo;ve looked up other languages from the Lisp family. Scheme is usually recommended to beginners who are serious about computer science. It&rsquo;s quite opinionated, but it is also minimalist and therefore good for learning.<br>
</p>

<p>
Racket is a modern, Scheme-like language (it has been called PLT Scheme before) that emphasizes &ldquo;language oriented programming&rdquo;. It means you design your own small (domain specific) programming languages for your application and then write your application in that language. But you don&rsquo;t have to &#x2014; you can just use &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Racket. So don&rsquo;t bother with that for now.<br>
</p>

<p>
Racket is also a platform for research and to create and run different programming languages (and good old Scheme is one of them). So even if you just want to learn the Scheme language, you can do it comfortably in Racket. That may sound a bit confusing, but it actually isn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll see.<br>
</p>

<p>
The most recommended book on programming is the timeless classic &ldquo;Structure and Interpretation of Programming Languages&rdquo;, abbreviatet &ldquo;SICP&rdquo;. It was written as an introduction for computer science students at MIT, but for me it was too much as a very first book on programming. But check it out anyway, it&rsquo;s really philosophical.<br>
</p>

<p>
If that&rsquo;s too heavy for you too, pick one of the others. I&rsquo;ve also started to read &ldquo;How to Design Programs&rdquo;, which is supposedly easier, but found it super earnest and dry. A stripped down teaching language (think: training wheels) is used within that book, and I&rsquo;m no friend of this approach. The other books are very different.<br>
</p>

<p>
You can get started very easily with Racket and/or Scheme &#x2013; one single install and go, no matter if you are on Windows, Linux or Mac. You don&rsquo;t even have to be familiar with the command line, because it comes with DrRacket, a very friendly programming environment (IDE)<br>

<h3 id="orgf8a1b95">Elixir</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf8a1b95">
<p>
It&rsquo;s a young language, built on top of the Erlang platform, a solid and integral building block of today&rsquo;s telecommunication networks. Your mobile provider&rsquo;s infrastructure runs likely on Erlang, and so does WhatsApp.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elixir has an approachable syntax and leverages an interesting concept, Erlang&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">actor model</a>. It makes Erlang/Elixir specifically suitable for concurrency, and it&rsquo;s a natural fit for distributed computing, peer-to-peer networking, messaging apps and servers with hundreds of thousands of simultaneous active users, internet of things, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>
What I don&rsquo;t like in Elixir are things like this: For instance, you can define functions in 3-5 (?) different ways: there are long forms, and there are short forms, and not all of those work everywhere, but which one does, depends on the context. Wtf?<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s nevertheless quite easy to get started with Elixir. You won&rsquo;t build anything graphical with Elixir directly, it&rsquo;s a language for the backend and infrastructure. How about building a bot or web scraper?<br>

<h3 id="orgf8df7f4">JavaScript</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf8df7f4">
<p>
With JavaScript, you can build all kind of things in the browser and show it to your internet friends, without having them to download or install anything (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;easy deployment&rdquo; of its finest). JavaScript is the only language browsers support directly, still &#x2013; and that&rsquo;s why everybody and their dog&rsquo;s fleas are coding JavaScript.<br>
</p>

<p>
The language has good tooling and is easy to start with, and you may have heard &ldquo;all you need is a web browser and a text editor&rdquo;. Well, um, no, unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not really the truth.<br>
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;ll need willingness to suffer. The language has a ton of WTFs and ugly corners, and you&rsquo;ll need to learn to avoid and remember those pitfalls, and using a <a href="https://eslint.org/">linter</a> is mandatory (that&rsquo;s a tool that checks your code and tells you where the problematic parts lie). Expect to write code to workaround the bad language design.<br>
</p>

<p>
Overall, syntax and semantics result in a verbose frankenstein language that&rsquo;s a pain to read. Of course there are the usual suspects who disagree and even &ldquo;love&rdquo; JavaScript. These are the people who either don&rsquo;t know any better, or who suffer from a variant of the Stockholm Syndrome. Honestly, that doesn&rsquo;t make it a good choice for a first time programmer, but despite the fact, many start to learn programming with JavaScript, unfortunally.<br>
</p>

<p>
It is an imperative language at the very heart, but you can write object-oriented and functional style too. JavaScript is far from standing still, but assimilating new features with each version and therefore getting bigger and bigger. Resistance is futile. Or is it?<br>
</p>

<p>
If you just wanna build web apps or browser games, you do have other choices: check out Clojure(Script), or Elm down below.<br>
</p>

<p>
If you really want to become a full stack web developer a. k. a. practising masochist (But why &#x2026; would you? We have enough web developers!), you could also learn the programming thing with a sane backend language first, as you can choose more freely here (how about Elixir or Clojure?), and then move on to JavaScript.<br>

<div id="outline-container-org0f20863" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0f20863">Elm</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0f20863">
<p>
Elm is a language that compiles to JavaScript: You write your website&rsquo;s code in Elm, and then the Elm compiler writes the JavaScript for you, so that your web browser can run it.<br>
</p>

<p>
If that sounds like it makes no sense, think about it this way: All programming languages compile down to another language on a lower level anyway, and those again and again, until your code&rsquo;s representation is only 11010101. Elm is just another layer on top.<br>
</p>

<p>
Why not writing JavaScript directly? Elm comes with a few interesting features: first and foremost a <i>static type system</i> (like Haskell), which helps you to be (more) sure about your code is correct (think: less undiscovered bugs). And you don&rsquo;t have to deal with JavaScripts screwed type coercion. Secondly, Elm supports the functional programming paradigm: That makes it&rsquo;s easier to reason about what code actually does. And it comes with <i>immmutable values</i> (Ever writhed in disgust when you saw <code>x = x + 1</code>? Then this is for you).<br>
</p>

<p>
The Elm syntax is simple and the Elm compiler famous for its helpful error messages &#x2013; like a built-in teacher who pushes you gently into the right direction on your path to statically typed functional programming. And you will learn one way how to structure your application: &ldquo;The Elm Architecture&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s why I consider Elm very well suited for learning, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s still a very young and domain-specifig language that runs exclusively in the browser. There is not much literature out there, but Elm opens the door to other languages from the same family: Haskell and OCaml.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elm is designed as a cathedral &#x2013; the installation is easy, tooling on par. But the language is quite opinionated: it&rsquo;s encouraged to do certain things like intended by the creators, similar to Python. But that has benefits too, and it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why everything within the Elm ecosystem fits so well together.<br>

<div id="outline-container-org7b37782" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7b37782">Haskell</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b37782">
<p>
Elm pointed me to Haskell, where most of Elm&rsquo;s ideas come from. So if I like Elm and it&rsquo;s a browser-only language, why not learn &ldquo;the real thing&rdquo;?<br>
</p>

<p>
Haskell has a <a href="https://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-syntax/">simple syntax</a>, it&rsquo;s just uncommon for programmers that are ingrained with the syntax and semantics of C/Java/PHP/JavaScript. However, Haskell&rsquo;s syntax relies a lot on cryptic infix operators (also custom ones) and with it come things like the precendece of those operators (from 0-9).<br>
</p>

<p>
Contrary to popular belief, basic Haskell is easy to learn; especially as a person who has never programmed before. It may be less easy for experienced programmers because of all the preconceptions they have about programming. But it&rsquo;s not a compact language, so it will get complicated later when you&rsquo;ll want to work with libraries and encounter code others have written. Haskellers tend to be clever, and they like to use the advanced features the language and its extensions have to offer.<br>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not so straightforward to get started with Haskell &#x2026; well, it depends. Downloading the compiler and starting <i>ghci</i> (the REPL) to evaluate some expressions is no big deal, and to compiling some code neither. But if you go a bit further and want some more convenience and install libraries, there are at least 3 approaches which tooling set to use, and they overlap in functionality, and &#x2026; I think that&rsquo;s a bit confusing for noobs.<br>
</p>

<p>
Not all hope is lost: You could start with either OCaml or Elm, and I think <i>why and how</i> to work with a static type system is easier to grasp with Elm. You can still move on to Haskell later, if you feel like. But if you wanna give it a shot, download <i>Stack</i> and then install everything else via Stack.<br>

<h3 id="org5ec8df7">OCaml</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ec8df7">
<p>
It&rsquo;s a interesting language in the same category like Elm and Haskell, namely the &ldquo;ML-family&rdquo;; statically typed and functional. It&rsquo;s more pragmatic (think: less opinionated) than Haskell, and the latest tooling looks more coordinated and designed as a whole. The Emacs support is awesome.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think syntax matters especially for noobs (in terms of not getting in your way), and I like the ML style syntax, because it doesn&rsquo;t have those {curly braces} spreading all over. OCaml is quite a bit more verbose than Haskell, but still pretty clear and pleasant to read.<br>
</p>

<p>
OCaml is famously used at Facebook and in Fintech, and in many places where correctness is of utter importance. It&rsquo;s also used to teach programming at French universities. Overrall, it seems less popular than Haskell; put another way, you could also say Haskell is overly hyped.<br>
</p>

<p>
The user experience is really nice on Linux, and OCaml works well on Windows with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</a>, too. But you may run into an issue during the installing process in WSL because of WSL&rsquo;s limitations; <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/12050#issuecomment-393478072">anyway, there&rsquo;s a workaround for that</a>.<br>

<h3 id="orgc4cff7a">Common Lisp</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc4cff7a">
<p>
The first reason for me to use a programming language wasn&rsquo;t coding, actually I wanted a better calculator. A REPL makes a way better calculator than the silly concept of an interface resembling a physical pocket calculator with big buttons and a single line display.<br>
</p>

<p>
Well, here Lisp&rsquo;s prefix notation felt really weird for doing arithmetik: Instead of <code>10 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7</code> you write <code>(+ 10 3 4 6 7)</code>. All Lisp languages have this uniform and simple syntax. It makes it easier to write programs who write programs who &#x2026; well, that&rsquo;s for later. The syntax is easy to remember so it doesn&rsquo;t get in your way, and you can concentrate on the things that really matter.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think the most compelling books and essays have been written on Lisp, and it has the best learning material I could find. Well, Lisp has been around for a while.<br>
</p>

<p>
What really fascinates me, is that Lisp is no &ldquo;black box&rdquo;, where you write some keywords and then something underneath does some things and you don&rsquo;t know what and why. Lisp is different: It is built on a few simple pieces, and everything else is built from those pieces &#x2013; it is transparent and easy to paint a mental picture how it actually works.<br>
</p>

<p>
The tooling is excellent and designed for interactive development. <b>There&rsquo;s a really nice <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cl-repl/id1511296102">App for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eql5.android.repl">Android</a> called &ldquo;CL REPL&rdquo;.</b> You can use it to tinker around when ever you feel like <i>&ldquo;Damn, I wish I could write some Lisp right now!&rdquo;</i> You can. It&rsquo;s in fact a complete Common Lisp IDE with SLIME, the &ldquo;Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs&rdquo;.<br>
</p>

<p>
But usually you want it on your laptop. I recommend Emacs with SLIME, and it&rsquo;s easy to install: <a href="https://portacle.github.io/">use Portacle</a>, which has everything bundled together with batteries included. If you don&rsquo;t know Emacs yet, do:<br>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Menu -&gt; &ldquo;Options&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Use CUA keys&rdquo;<br></li>
<li>Menu -&gt; &ldquo;Options&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Save options&rdquo;<br></li>

<h3 id="org79115f5">Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79115f5">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve considered learning Python a ffcouple of years ago, but after some research I found other languages more elegant and interesting, and it seems that Python is a lot of lackduster &#x2013; looking elegant on the surface, but inconsistent when you look under the rug.<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m listing it here nonetheless, because it&rsquo;s one of the 3 most popular languages right now (behind C and Java). Python emphasizes user friendlyness and it has really comprehensible error messages. The language is used in many domains, from small scripts to scientific computing. Python usually serves as the glue code to connect all the parts of a particular software project.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are Python libraries for everything, which adds to popularity. On the technical site, many of those libraries are actually written in C for performance reasons, because Python itself is by far the slowest of the languages listed here. If you want a scripting language which is even easier to learn but really fast, you may have some fun with Lua.<br>
</p>

<p>
Python is also a very opinionated language: The creators encourage that certain things should be done in &ldquo;the right way&rdquo; &#x2013; which is called &rsquo;pythonic&rsquo;. The opposite is &rsquo;unpythonic&rsquo;: To describe something as &rsquo;clever&rsquo; is not considered a compliment in the Python cult-ure. Well, you may be more pragmatic and don&rsquo;t care, but that mindset is putting me off.<br>

Julia is developed as a high performance vehicle for technical and scientific computing, like data science, simulations, as an alternative to Python and a couple other languages in the field. Most scientists already how to program their stuff, so don&rsquo;t expect much introduction material for total beginners.<br>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s still a young language, but hyped by a couple of organizations. So there&rsquo;s more of an ecosystem than you would expect for a language in that early state.<br>
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve considered to learn Julia because there are some interesting aspects. Julia can do some things that Lisps can, but contrary to Lisps, Julia neither uses prefix-notation syntax nor nestet parantheses.<br>
</p>

<p>
Julia looks friendly and easy to start with, and you should definitely check it out if you&rsquo;re a student or scientist. I think it&rsquo;s a very promising general-purpose language.<br>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org33ef90e">
<p>
Choose well, but don&rsquo;t obsess too much about it: I&rsquo;ve already done that part for you! You are going to learn a couple more programming languages after your first one, so it&rsquo;s not a lifetime decision, even if you feel like that now.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some courses/books teach programming using stripped-down teaching languages, or even pseudocode. I oppose this approach, because you cannot use the teaching language to build anything useful along the way; you learn something you have no use for later on; and the teaching languages are often not subsets of a real programming language, which may lead to confusion thanks to a slightly off terminology.<br>
</p>

<p>
On my shortlist there were Lua, JavaScript, Haskell and a Lisp, ultimately decided to start with Common Lisp.<br>
</p>

<p>
If I would have to make a ranking list for a imaginary &ldquo;You&rdquo; &#x2026; well, that&rsquo;s not really possible. But there are a few programming languages standing out:<br>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Lua<br></li>
<li>Lisp (either Racket, Clojure or Common Lisp)<br></li>
<li>Elm<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Although those three are not the most used in the industry, they are well-designed, mind-expanding programming languages and good choices for first time learners, as they fit most criteria above very well.<br>
</p>

<p>
After learning programming with one of them, you could go on and make a popular 1st-tier bread-and-butter-language your second endeavour, like JavaScript, Python, Java, Go or C++. Have fun :)<br>
